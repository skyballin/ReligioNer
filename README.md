ReligioNer Application - Connecting religions through text analysis

This is a flask application that you can run by:
  - Clone the repo
  - Navigate to the ReligioNer/code/myapp folder
  - Ensure Localhost:6969 is an open port
  - Type python myapp.py in terminal
  - Play with the app as you please! 

Current functionality:
  - Home Page
  - Text Similarity Page
  - About Page

Soon to be functionality:
  - Graph Page
  - Examples Page

I will give a much more extensive README update once the app is fully functional.

Thanks!
