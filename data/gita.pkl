aS' Dhritirashtra: Ranged thus for battle on the sacred plain-- On Kurukshetra--say, Sanjaya! say What wrought my people, and the Pandavas?'
p55
aS' Sanjaya: When he beheld the host of Pandavas, Raja Duryodhana to Drona drew, And spake these words: "Ah, Guru! see this line, How vast it is of Pandu fighting-men, Embattled by the son of Drupada, Thy scholar in the war! Therein stand ranked Chiefs like Arjuna, like to Bhima chiefs, Benders of bows; Virata, Yuyudhan, Drupada, eminent upon his car, Dhrishtaket, Chekitan, Kasi\'s stout lord, Purujit, Kuntibhoj, and Saivya, With Yudhamanyu, and Uttamauj Subhadra\'s child; and Drupadi\'s;-all famed! All mounted on their shining chariots! On our side, too,--thou best of Brahmans! see Excellent chiefs, commanders of my line, Whose names I joy to count: thyself the first, Then Bhishma, Karna, Kripa fierce in fight, Vikarna, Aswatthaman; next to these Strong Saumadatti, with full many more Valiant and tried, ready this day to die For me their king, each with his weapon grasped, Each skilful in the field. Weakest-meseems- Our battle shows where Bhishma holds command, And Bhima, fronting him, something too strong! Have care our captains nigh to Bhishma\'s ranks Prepare what help they may! Now, blow my shell!"'

aS" Then, at the signal of the aged king, With blare to wake the blood, rolling around Like to a lion's roar, the trumpeter Blew the great Conch; and, at the noise of it, Trumpets and drums, cymbals and gongs and horns Burst into sudden clamour; as the blasts Of loosened tempest, such the tumult seemed! Then might be seen, upon their car of gold Yoked with white steeds, blowing their battle-shells,"
p57
aS' Krishna the God, Arjuna at his side: Krishna, with knotted locks, blew his great conch Carved of the "Giant\'s bone;" Arjuna blew Indra\'s loud gift; Bhima the terrible-- Wolf-bellied Bhima-blew a long reed-conch; And Yudhisthira, Kunti\'s blameless son, Winded a mighty shell, "Victory\'s Voice;" And Nakula blew shrill upon his conch Named the "Sweet-sounding," Sahadev on his Called "Gem-bedecked," and Kasi\'s Prince on his. Sikhandi on his car, Dhrishtadyumn, Virata, Satyaki the Unsubdued, Drupada, with his sons, (O Lord of Earth!) Long-armed Subhadra\'s children, all blew loud, So that the clangour shook their foemen\'s hearts, With quaking earth and thundering heav\'n. Then \'twas- Beholding Dhritirashtra\'s battle set, Weapons unsheathing, bows drawn forth, the war Instant to break-Arjun, whose ensign-badge Was Hanuman the monkey, spake this thing'
p58
aS' To Krishna the Divine, his charioteer: "Drive, Dauntless One! to yonder open ground Betwixt the armies; I would see more nigh These who will fight with us, those we must slay To-day, in war\'s arbitrament; for, sure, On bloodshed all are bent who throng this plain, Obeying Dhritirashtra\'s sinful son."'
p59
aS' Thus, by Arjuna prayed, (O Bharata!) Between the hosts that heavenly Charioteer Drove the bright car, reining its milk-white steeds Where Bhishma led,and Drona,and their Lords. "See!" spake he to Arjuna, "where they stand, Thy kindred of the Kurus:" and the Prince Marked on each hand the kinsmen of his house, Grandsires and sires, uncles and brothers and sons, Cousins and sons-in-law and nephews, mixed With friends and honoured elders; some this side, Some that side ranged: and, seeing those opposed, Such kith grown enemies-Arjuna\'s heart Melted with pity, while he uttered this:'
p60
aS" Arjuna. Krishna! as I behold, come here to shed Their common blood, yon concourse of our kin, My members fail, my tongue dries in my mouth, A shudder thrills my body, and my hair Bristles with horror; from my weak hand slips Gandiv, the goodly bow; a fever burns My skin to parching; hardly may I stand; The life within me seems to swim and faint; Nothing do I foresee save woe and wail! It is not good, O Keshav! nought of good Can spring from mutual slaughter! Lo, I hate Triumph and domination, wealth and ease, Thus sadly won! Aho! what victory Can bring delight, Govinda! what rich spoils Could profit; what rule recompense; what span Of life itself seem sweet, bought with such blood? Seeing that these stand here, ready to die, For whose sake life was fair, and pleasure pleased, And power grew precious:-grandsires, sires, and sons, Brothers, and fathers-in-law, and sons-in-law, Elders and friends! Shall I deal death on these Even though they seek to slay us? Not one blow, O Madhusudan! will I strike to gain The rule of all Three Worlds; then, how much less To seize an earthly kingdom! Killing these Must breed but anguish, Krishna! If they be Guilty, we shall grow guilty by their deaths; Their sins will light on us, if we shall slay Those sons of Dhritirashtra, and our kin; What peace could come of that, O Madhava? For if indeed, blinded by lust and wrath, These cannot see, or will not see, the sin Of kingly lines o'erthrown and kinsmen slain, How should not we, who see, shun such a crime-- We who perceive the guilt and feel the shame-- O thou Delight of Men, Janardana? By overthrow of houses perisheth Their sweet continuous household piety, And-rites neglected, piety extinct-- Enters impiety upon that home; Its women grow unwomaned, whence there spring Mad passions, and the mingling-up of castes, Sending a Hell-ward road that family, And whoso wrought its doom by wicked wrath. Nay, and the souls of honoured ancestors Fall from their place of peace, being bereft Of funeral-cakes and the wan death-water. So teach our holy hymns. Thus, if we slay Kinsfolk and friends for love of earthly power, Ahovat! what an evil fault it were! Better I deem it, if my kinsmen strike, To face them weaponless, and bare my breast To shaft and spear, than answer blow with blow. So speaking, in the face of those two hosts, Arjuna sank upon his chariot-seat, And let fall bow and arrows, sick at heart."
p61
aS' Sanjaya. Him, filled with such compassion and such grief, With eyes tear-dimmed, despondent, in stern words The Driver, Madhusudan, thus addressed:'
p62
aS' Krishna. How hath this weakness taken thee? Whence springs The inglorious trouble, shameful to the brave, Barring the path of virtue? Nay, Arjun! Forbid thyself to feebleness! it mars Thy warrior-name! cast off the coward-fit! Wake! Be thyself! Arise, Scourge of thy Foes!'
p63
aS" Arjuna. How can I, in the battle, shoot with shafts On Bhishma, or on Drona-O thou Chief!-- Both worshipful, both honourable men? Better to live on beggar's bread With those we love alive, Than taste their blood in rich feasts spread, And guiltily survive! Ah! were it worse-who knows?--to be Victor or vanquished here, When those confront us angrily Whose death leaves living drear? In pity lost, by doubtings tossed, My thoughts-distracted-turn To Thee, the Guide I reverence most, That I may counsel learn: I know not what would heal the grief Burned into soul and sense, If I were earth's unchallenged chief-- A god--and these gone thence!"
p64
aS' Sanjaya. So spake Arjuna to the Lord of Hearts, And sighing,"I will not fight!" held silence then. To whom, with tender smile, (O Bharata! ) While the Prince wept despairing \'twixt those hosts, Krishna made answer in divinest verse:'
p65
aS' Krishna. Thou grievest where no grief should be! thou speak\'st Words lacking wisdom! for the wise in heart Mourn not for those that live, nor those that die. Nor I, nor thou, nor any one of these, Ever was not, nor ever will not be, For ever and for ever afterwards. All, that doth live, lives always! To man\'s frame As there come infancy and youth and age, So come there raisings-up and layings-down Of other and of other life-abodes, Which the wise know, and fear not. This that irks-- Thy sense-life, thrilling to the elements-- Bringing thee heat and cold, sorrows and joys, \'Tis brief and mutable! Bear with it, Prince! As the wise bear. The soul which is not moved, The soul that with a strong and constant calm Takes sorrow and takes joy indifferently, Lives in the life undying! That which is Can never cease to be; that which is not Will not exist. To see this truth of both Is theirs who part essence from accident, Substance from shadow. Indestructible, Learn thou! the Life is, spreading life through all; It cannot anywhere, by any means, Be anywise diminished, stayed, or changed. But for these fleeting frames which it informs With spirit deathless, endless, infinite, They perish. Let them perish, Prince! and fight! He who shall say, "Lo! I have slain a man!" He who shall think, "Lo! I am slain!" those both Know naught! Life cannot slay. Life is not slain! Never the spirit was born; the spirit shall cease to be never; Never was time it was not; End and Beginning are dreams! Birthless and deathless and changeless remaineth the spirit for ever; Death hath not touched it at all, dead though the house of it seems! Who knoweth it exhaustless, self-sustained, Immortal, indestructible,--shall such Say, "I have killed a man, or caused to kill?" Nay, but as when one layeth His worn-out robes away, And taking new ones, sayeth, "These will I wear to-day!" So putteth by the spirit Lightly its garb of flesh, And passeth to inherit A residence afresh. I say to thee weapons reach not the Life; Flame burns it not, waters cannot o\'erwhelm, Nor dry winds wither it. Impenetrable, Unentered, unassailed, unharmed, untouched, Immortal, all-arriving, stable, sure, Invisible, ineffable, by word And thought uncompassed, ever all itself, Thus is the Soul declared! How wilt thou, then,-- Knowing it so,--grieve when thou shouldst not grieve? How, if thou hearest that the man new-dead Is, like the man new-born, still living man-- One same, existent Spirit--wilt thou weep? The end of birth is death; the end of death Is birth: this is ordained! and mournest thou, Chief of the stalwart arm! for what befalls Which could not otherwise befall? The birth Of living things comes unperceived; the death Comes unperceived; between them, beings perceive:'
p66
aS" What is there sorrowful herein, dear Prince? Wonderful, wistful, to contemplate! Difficult, doubtful, to speak upon! Strange and great for tongue to relate, Mystical hearing for every one! Nor wotteth man this, what a marvel it is, When seeing, and saying, and hearing are done! This Life within all living things, my Prince! Hides beyond harm; scorn thou to suffer, then, For that which cannot suffer. Do thy part! Be mindful of thy name, and tremble not! Nought better can betide a martial soul Than lawful war; happy the warrior To whom comes joy of battle--comes, as now, Glorious and fair, unsought; opening for him A gateway unto Heav'n. But, if thou shunn'st This honourable field--a Kshattriya-- If, knowing thy duty and thy task, thou bidd'st Duty and task go by--that shall be sin! And those to come shall speak thee infamy From age to age; but infamy is worse For men of noble blood to bear than death! The chiefs upon their battle-chariots Will deem 'twas fear that drove thee from the fray. Of those who held thee mighty-souled the scorn Thou must abide, while all thine enemies Will scatter bitter speech of thee, to mock The valour which thou hadst; what fate could fall More grievously than this? Either--being killed-- Thou wilt win Swarga's safety, or--alive And victor--thou wilt reign an earthly king."
p67
aS' Therefore, arise, thou Son of Kunti! brace Thine arm for conflict, nerve thy heart to meet-- As things alike to thee--pleasure or pain, Profit or ruin, victory or defeat: So minded, gird thee to the fight, for so Thou shalt not sin! Thus far I speak to thee As from the "Sankhya"--unspiritually-- Hear now the deeper teaching of the Yog, Which holding, understanding, thou shalt burst Thy Karmabandh, the bondage of wrought deeds. Here shall no end be hindered, no hope marred, No loss be feared: faith--yea, a little faith-- Shall save thee from the anguish of thy dread. Here, Glory of the Kurus! shines one rule-- One steadfast rule--while shifting souls have laws Many and hard. '
p68
aS' Specious, but wrongful deem The speech of those ill-taught ones who extol The letter of their Vedas, saying, "This Is all we have, or need;" being weak at heart With wants, seekers of Heaven: which comes--they say-- As "fruit of good deeds done;" promising men Much profit in new births for works of faith; In various rites abounding; following whereon Large merit shall accrue towards wealth and power; Albeit, who wealth and power do most desire Least fixity of soul have such, least hold On heavenly meditation. Much these teach, From Veds, concerning the "three qualities;" But thou, be free of the "three qualities," Free of the "pairs of opposites," and free From that sad righteousness which calculates; Self-ruled, Arjuna! simple, satisfied! Look! like as when a tank pours water forth To suit all needs, so do these Brahmans draw Text for all wants from tank of Holy Writ.'
p69
aS' But thou, want not! ask not! Find full reward Of doing right in right! Let right deeds be Thy motive, not the fruit which comes from them. And live in action! Labour! Make thine acts Thy piety, casting all self aside, Contemning gain and merit; equable In good or evil: equability Is Yog, is piety! Yet, the right act Is less, far less, than the right-thinking mind. Seek refuge in thy soul; have there thy heaven!'
p70
aS" Scorn them that follow virtue for her gifts! The mind of pure devotion--even here-- Casts equally aside good deeds and bad, Passing above them. Unto pure devotion Devote thyself: with perfect meditation Comes perfect act, and the right-hearted rise-- More certainly because they seek no gain-- Forth from the bands of body, step by step, To highest seats of bliss. When thy firm soul Hath shaken off those tangled oracles Which ignorantly guide, then shall it soar To high neglect of what's denied or said, This way or that way, in doctrinal writ. Troubled no longer by the priestly lore, Safe shall it live, and sure; steadfastly bent On meditation. This is Yog--and Peace!"
p71
aS' Arjuna. What is his mark who hath that steadfast heart, Confirmed in holy meditation? How Know we his speech, Kesava? Sits he, moves he Like other men?'
p72
aS" Krishna. When one, O Pritha's Son! Abandoning desires which shake the mind-- Finds in his soul full comfort for his soul, He hath attained the Yog--that man is such! In sorrows not dejected, and in joys Not overjoyed; dwelling outside the stress Of passion, fear, and anger; fixed in calms Of lofty contemplation;--such an one Is Muni, is the Sage, the true Recluse! He who to none and nowhere overbound By ties of flesh, takes evil things and good Neither desponding nor exulting, such Bears wisdom's plainest mark! He who shall draw As the wise tortoise draws its four feet safe Under its shield, his five frail senses back Under the spirit's buckler from the world Which else assails them, such an one, my Prince!"
p73
aS" Hath wisdom's mark! Things that solicit sense Hold off from the self-governed; nay, it comes, The appetites of him who lives beyond Depart,--aroused no more. Yet may it chance, O Son of Kunti! that a governed mind Shall some time feel the sense-storms sweep, and wrest Strong self-control by the roots. Let him regain His kingdom! let him conquer this, and sit On Me intent. That man alone is wise Who keeps the mastery of himself! If one Ponders on objects of the sense, there springs Attraction; from attraction grows desire, Desire flames to fierce passion, passion breeds Recklessness; then the memory--all betrayed-- Lets noble purpose go, and saps the mind, Till purpose, mind, and man are all undone. "
p74
aS' But, if one deals with objects of the sense Not loving and not hating, making them Serve his free soul, which rests serenely lord, Lo! such a man comes to tranquillity; And out of that tranquillity shall rise The end and healing of his earthly pains, Since the will governed sets the soul at peace. The soul of the ungoverned is not his, Nor hath he knowledge of himself; which lacked, How grows serenity? and, wanting that, Whence shall he hope for happiness? The mind That gives itself to follow shows of sense Seeth its helm of wisdom rent away, And, like a ship in waves of whirlwind, drives To wreck and death. Only with him, great Prince!'
p75
aS" Whose senses are not swayed by things of sense-- Only with him who holds his mastery, Shows wisdom perfect. What is midnight-gloom To unenlightened souls shines wakeful day To his clear gaze; what seems as wakeful day Is known for night, thick night of ignorance, To his true-seeing eyes. Such is the Saint! And like the ocean, day by day receiving Floods from all lands, which never overflows Its boundary-line not leaping, and not leaving, Fed by the rivers, but unswelled by those;-- So is the perfect one! to his soul's ocean The world of sense pours streams of witchery; They leave him as they find, without commotion, Taking their tribute, but remaining sea."
p76
aS' Yea! whoso, shaking off the yoke of flesh Lives lord, not servant, of his lusts; set free From pride, from passion, from the sin of "Self," Toucheth tranquillity! O Pritha\'s Son! That is the state of Brahm! There rests no dread When that last step is reached! Live where he will, Die when he may, such passeth from all \'plaining, To blest Nirvana, with the Gods, attaining.'
p77
aS' Arjuna. Thou whom all mortals praise, Janardana! If meditation be a nobler thing Than action, wherefore, then, great Kesava! Dost thou impel me to this dreadful fight? Now am I by thy doubtful speech disturbed! Tell me one thing, and tell me certainly; By what road shall I find the better end?'
p78
aS" Krishna. I told thee, blameless Lord! there be two paths Shown to this world; two schools of wisdom. First The Sankhya's, which doth save in way of works Prescribed by reason; next, the Yog, which bids Attain by meditation, spiritually:"
p79
aS' Yet these are one! No man shall \'scape from act By shunning action; nay, and none shall come By mere renouncements unto perfectness. Nay, and no jot of time, at any time, Rests any actionless; his nature\'s law Compels him, even unwilling, into act; For thought is act in fancy. He who sits Suppressing all the instruments of flesh, Yet in his idle heart thinking on them, Plays the inept and guilty hypocrite: But he who, with strong body serving mind, Gives up his mortal powers to worthy work, Not seeking gain, Arjuna! such an one Is honourable. Do thine allotted task! Work is more excellent than idleness; The body\'s life proceeds not, lacking work. There is a task of holiness to do, Unlike world-binding toil, which bindeth not The faithful soul; such earthly duty do Free from desire, and thou shalt well perform Thy heavenly purpose. Spake Prajapati-- In the beginning, when all men were made, And, with mankind, the sacrifice-- "Do this! '
p80
aS' Work! sacrifice! Increase and multiply With sacrifice! This shall be Kamaduk, Your \'Cow of Plenty,\' giving back her milk Of all abundance. Worship the gods thereby; The gods shall yield thee grace. Those meats ye crave The gods will grant to Labour, when it pays Tithes in the altar-flame. But if one eats Fruits of the earth, rendering to kindly Heaven No gift of toil, that thief steals from his world." Who eat of food after their sacrifice Are quit of fault, but they that spread a feast All for themselves, eat sin and drink of sin. By food the living live; food comes of rain, And rain comes by the pious sacrifice, And sacrifice is paid with tithes of toil; Thus action is of Brahma, who is One, The Only, All-pervading; at all times Present in sacrifice. He that abstains To help the rolling wheels of this great world, Glutting his idle sense, lives a lost life, Shameful and vain. Existing for himself, Self-concentrated, serving self alone, No part hath he in aught; nothing achieved, Nought wrought or unwrought toucheth him; no hope Of help for all the living things of earth Depends from him. Therefore, thy task prescribed With spirit unattached gladly perform, Since in performance of plain duty man Mounts to his highest bliss. By works alone Janak and ancient saints reached blessedness! Moreover, for the upholding of thy kind, Action thou should\'st embrace. What the wise choose The unwise people take; what best men do The multitude will follow. Look on me, Thou Son of Pritha! in the three wide worlds I am not bound to any toil, no height Awaits to scale, no gift remains to gain, Yet I act here! and, if I acted not-- Earnest and watchful--those that look to me For guidance, sinking back to sloth again Because I slumbered, would decline from good, And I should break earth\'s order and commit Her offspring unto ruin, Bharata! Even as the unknowing toil, wedded to sense, So let the enlightened toil, sense-freed, but set To bring the world deliverance, and its bliss; Not sowing in those simple, busy hearts Seed of despair. Yea! let each play his part In all he finds to do, with unyoked soul. All things are everywhere by Nature wrought In interaction of the qualities.'
p81
aS' The fool, cheated by self, thinks, "This I did" And "That I wrought; "but--ah, thou strong-armed Prince!-- A better-lessoned mind, knowing the play Of visible things within the world of sense, And how the qualities must qualify, Standeth aloof even from his acts. Th\' untaught Live mixed with them, knowing not Nature\'s way, Of highest aims unwitting, slow and dull. Those make thou not to stumble, having the light; But all thy dues discharging, for My sake, With meditation centred inwardly, Seeking no profit, satisfied, serene, Heedless of issue--fight! They who shall keep My ordinance thus, the wise and willing hearts, Have quittance from all issue of their acts; But those who disregard My ordinance, Thinking they know, know nought, and fall to loss, Confused and foolish. \'Sooth, the instructed one Doth of his kind, following what fits him most:'
p82
aS" And lower creatures of their kind; in vain Contending 'gainst the law. Needs must it be The objects of the sense will stir the sense To like and dislike, yet th' enlightened man Yields not to these, knowing them enemies. Finally, this is better, that one do His own task as he may, even though he fail, Than take tasks not his own, though they seem good. To die performing duty is no ill; But who seeks other roads shall wander still."
p83
aS' Arjuna. Yet tell me, Teacher! by what force doth man Go to his ill, unwilling; as if one Pushed him that evil path?'
p84
aS" Krishna. Kama it is! Passion it is! born of the Darknesses, Which pusheth him. Mighty of appetite, Sinful, and strong is this!--man's enemy! As smoke blots the white fire, as clinging rust Mars the bright mirror, as the womb surrounds The babe unborn, so is the world of things Foiled, soiled, enclosed in this desire of flesh. The wise fall, caught in it; the unresting foe It is of wisdom, wearing countless forms, Fair but deceitful, subtle as a flame. Sense, mind, and reason--these, O Kunti's Son!"
p85
aS" Are booty for it; in its play with these It maddens man, beguiling, blinding him. Therefore, thou noblest child of Bharata! Govern thy heart! Constrain th' entangled sense! Resist the false, soft sinfulness which saps Knowledge and judgment! Yea, the world is strong, But what discerns it stronger, and the mind Strongest; and high o'er all the ruling Soul. Wherefore, perceiving Him who reigns supreme, Put forth full force of Soul in thy own soul! Fight! vanquish foes and doubts, dear Hero! slay What haunts thee in fond shapes, and would betray!"
p86
aS' Krishna. This deathless Yoga, this deep union, I taught Vivaswata, the Lord of Light; Vivaswata to Manu gave it; he To Ikshwaku; so passed it down the line Of all my royal Rishis. Then, with years, The truth grew dim and perished, noble Prince! Now once again to thee it is declared-- This ancient lore, this mystery supreme-- Seeing I find thee votary and friend.'
p87
aS' Arjuna. Thy birth, dear Lord, was in these later days, And bright Vivaswata\'s preceded time! How shall I comprehend this thing thou sayest, "From the beginning it was I who taught?"'
p88
aS' Krishna. Manifold the renewals of my birth Have been, Arjuna! and of thy births, too! But mine I know, and thine thou knowest not, O Slayer of thy Foes! Albeit I be Unborn, undying, indestructible, The Lord of all things living; not the less-- By Maya, by my magic which I stamp On floating Nature-forms, the primal vast-- I come, and go, and come. When Righteousness Declines, O Bharata! when Wickedness Is strong, I rise, from age to age, and take Visible shape, and move a man with men, Succouring the good, thrusting the evil back, And setting Virtue on her seat again.'
p89
aS' Who knows the truth touching my births on earth And my divine work, when he quits the flesh Puts on its load no more, falls no more down To earthly birth: to Me he comes, dear Prince! Many there be who come! from fear set free, From anger, from desire; keeping their hearts Fixed upon me--my Faithful--purified By sacred flame of Knowledge. Such as these Mix with my being. Whoso worship me, Them I exalt; but all men everywhere Shall fall into my path; albeit, those souls Which seek reward for works, make sacrifice Now, to the lower gods. I say to thee Here have they their reward. But I am He Made the Four Castes, and portioned them a place After their qualities and gifts. Yea, I Created, the Reposeful; I that live Immortally, made all those mortal births: For works soil not my essence, being works Wrought uninvolved. Who knows me acting thus Unchained by action, action binds not him; And, so perceiving, all those saints of old Worked, seeking for deliverance. Work thou As, in the days gone by, thy fathers did.'
p90
aS' Thou sayst, perplexed, It hath been asked before By singers and by sages, "What is act, And what inaction? "I will teach thee this, And, knowing, thou shalt learn which work doth save Needs must one rightly meditate those three-- Doing,--not doing,--and undoing. Here Thorny and dark the path is! He who sees How action may be rest, rest action--he Is wisest \'mid his kind; he hath the truth! He doeth well, acting or resting. Freed In all his works from prickings of desire, Burned clean in act by the white fire of truth, The wise call that man wise; and such an one, Renouncing fruit of deeds, always content.'
p91
aS" Always self-satisfying, if he works, Doth nothing that shall stain his separate soul, Which--quit of fear and hope--subduing self-- Rejecting outward impulse--yielding up To body's need nothing save body, dwells Sinless amid all sin, with equal calm Taking what may befall, by grief unmoved, Unmoved by joy, unenvyingly; the same In good and evil fortunes; nowise bound By bond of deeds. Nay, but of such an one, Whose crave is gone, whose soul is liberate, Whose heart is set on truth--of such an one What work he does is work of sacrifice, Which passeth purely into ash and smoke Consumed upon the altar! All's then God!"
p92
aS' The sacrifice is Brahm, the ghee and grain Are Brahm, the fire is Brahm, the flesh it eats Is Brahm, and unto Brahm attaineth he Who, in such office, meditates on Brahm. '
p93
aS' Some votaries there be who serve the gods With flesh and altar-smoke; but other some Who, lighting subtler fires, make purer rite With will of worship. Of the which be they Who, in white flame of continence, consume Joys of the sense, delights of eye and ear, Forgoing tender speech and sound of song: And they who, kindling fires with torch of Truth, Burn on a hidden altar-stone the bliss Of youth and love, renouncing happiness: And they who lay for offering there their wealth, Their penance, meditation, piety, Their steadfast reading of the scrolls, their lore Painfully gained with long austerities: And they who, making silent sacrifice, Draw in their breath to feed the flame of thought, And breathe it forth to waft the heart on high, Governing the ventage of each entering air Lest one sigh pass which helpeth not the soul: And they who, day by day denying needs, Lay life itself upon the altar-flame, Burning the body wan. Lo! all these keep The rite of offering, as if they slew Victims; and all thereby efface much sin.'
p94
aS' Yea! and who feed on the immortal food Left of such sacrifice, to Brahma pass, To The Unending. But for him that makes No sacrifice, he hath nor part nor lot Even in the present world. How should he share Another, O thou Glory of thy Line? '
p95
aS" In sight of Brahma all these offerings Are spread and are accepted! Comprehend That all proceed by act; for knowing this, Thou shalt be quit of doubt. The sacrifice Which Knowledge pays is better than great gifts Offered by wealth, since gifts' worth--O my Prince!"
p96
aS' Lies in the mind which gives, the will that serves: And these are gained by reverence, by strong search, By humble heed of those who see the Truth And teach it. Knowing Truth, thy heart no more Will ache with error, for the Truth shall show All things subdued to thee, as thou to Me.'
p97
aS" Moreover, Son of Pandu! wert thou worst Of all wrong-doers, this fair ship of Truth Should bear thee safe and dry across the sea Of thy transgressions. As the kindled flame Feeds on the fuel till it sinks to ash, So unto ash, Arjuna! unto nought The flame of Knowledge wastes works' dross away! There is no purifier like thereto In all this world, and he who seeketh it Shall find it--being grown perfect--in himself."
p98
aS' Believing, he receives it when the soul Masters itself, and cleaves to Truth, and comes-- Possessing knowledge--to the higher peace, The uttermost repose. But those untaught, And those without full faith, and those who fear Are shent; no peace is here or other where, No hope, nor happiness for whoso doubts.'
p99
aS' He that, being self-contained, hath vanquished doubt, Disparting self from service, soul from works, Enlightened and emancipate, my Prince! Works fetter him no more! Cut then atwain With sword of wisdom, Son of Bharata! This doubt that binds thy heart-beats! cleave the bond Born of thy ignorance! Be bold and wise! Give thyself to the field with me! Arise!'
p100
aS' Arjuna. Yet, Krishna! at the one time thou dost laud Surcease of works, and, at another time, Service through work. Of these twain plainly tell Which is the better way?'
p101
aS' Krishna. To cease from works Is well, and to do works in holiness Is well; and both conduct to bliss supreme; But of these twain the better way is his Who working piously refraineth not.'
p102
aS' That is the true Renouncer, firm and fixed, Who--seeking nought, rejecting nought--dwells proof Against the "opposites." O valiant Prince! In doing, such breaks lightly from all deed: \'Tis the new scholar talks as they were two, This Sankhya and this Yoga: wise men know Who husbands one plucks golden fruit of both! The region of high rest which Sankhyans reach Yogins attain. Who sees these twain as one Sees with clear eyes! Yet such abstraction, Chief! Is hard to win without much holiness. Whoso is fixed in holiness, self-ruled, Pure-hearted, lord of senses and of self, Lost in the common life of all which lives-- A "Yogayukt"--he is a Saint who wends Straightway to Brahm. Such an one is not touched By taint of deeds. "Nought of myself I do!"'
p103
aS' Thus will he think-who holds the truth of truths-- In seeing, hearing, touching, smelling; when He eats, or goes, or breathes; slumbers or talks, Holds fast or loosens, opes his eyes or shuts; Always assured "This is the sense-world plays With senses."He that acts in thought of Brahm, Detaching end from act, with act content, The world of sense can no more stain his soul Than waters mar th\' enamelled lotus-leaf.'
p104
aS' With life, with heart, with mind,-nay, with the help Of all five senses--letting selfhood go-- Yogins toil ever towards their souls\' release. Such votaries, renouncing fruit of deeds, Gain endless peace: the unvowed, the passion-bound, Seeking a fruit from works, are fastened down. The embodied sage, withdrawn within his soul, At every act sits godlike in "the town Which hath nine gateways," neither doing aught Nor causing any deed. This world\'s Lord makes Neither the work, nor passion for the work, Nor lust for fruit of work; the man\'s own self Pushes to these! The Master of this World Takes on himself the good or evil deeds Of no man--dwelling beyond! Mankind errs here By folly, darkening knowledge. But, for whom That darkness of the soul is chased by light, Splendid and clear shines manifest the Truth As if a Sun of Wisdom sprang to shed Its beams of dawn. Him meditating still, Him seeking, with Him blended, stayed on Him, The souls illuminated take that road Which hath no turning back--their sins flung off By strength of faith. [Who will may have this Light;'

aS" Who hath it sees.] To him who wisely sees, The Brahman with his scrolls and sanctities, The cow, the elephant, the unclean dog, The Outcast gorging dog's meat, are all one."
p106
aS' The world is overcome--aye! even here! By such as fix their faith on Unity. The sinless Brahma dwells in Unity, And they in Brahma. Be not over-glad Attaining joy, and be not over-sad Encountering grief, but, stayed on Brahma, still Constant let each abide! The sage whose soul Holds off from outer contacts, in himself Finds bliss; to Brahma joined by piety, His spirit tastes eternal peace. The joys Springing from sense-life are but quickening wombs Which breed sure griefs: those joys begin and end!'
p107
aS" The wise mind takes no pleasure, Kunti's Son! In such as those! But if a man shall learn, Even while he lives and bears his body's chain, To master lust and anger, he is blest!"
p108
aS" He is the Yukta; he hath happiness, Contentment, light, within: his life is merged In Brahma's life; he doth Nirvana touch! Thus go the Rishis unto rest, who dwell With sins effaced, with doubts at end, with hearts Governed and calm. Glad in all good they live, Nigh to the peace of God; and all those live Who pass their days exempt from greed and wrath, Subduing self and senses, knowing the Soul!"
p109
aS' The Saint who shuts outside his placid soul All touch of sense, letting no contact through; Whose quiet eyes gaze straight from fixed brows, Whose outward breath and inward breath are drawn Equal and slow through nostrils still and close; That one-with organs, heart, and mind constrained, Bent on deliverance, having put away Passion, and fear, and rage;--hath, even now, Obtained deliverance, ever and ever freed. '
p110
aS' Yea! for he knows Me Who am He that heeds The sacrifice and worship, God revealed; And He who heeds not, being Lord of Worlds, Lover of all that lives, God unrevealed, Wherein who will shall find surety and shield!'
p111
aS' Krishna. Therefore, who doeth work rightful to do, Not seeking gain from work, that man, O Prince! Is Sanyasi and Yogi--both in one And he is neither who lights not the flame Of sacrifice, nor setteth hand to task. Regard as true Renouncer him that makes Worship by work, for who renounceth not Works not as Yogin. So is that well said: "By works the votary doth rise to faith, And saintship is the ceasing from all works; Because the perfect Yogin acts--but acts Unmoved by passions and unbound by deeds, Setting result aside.'
p112
aS" Let each man raise The Self by Soul, not trample down his Self, Since Soul that is Self's friend may grow Self's foe. Soul is Self's friend when Self doth rule o'er Self, But Self turns enemy if Soul's own self Hates Self as not itself."
p113
aS' The sovereign soul Of him who lives self-governed and at peace Is centred in itself, taking alike Pleasure and pain; heat, cold; glory and shame. He is the Yogi, he is Yukta, glad With joy of light and truth; dwelling apart Upon a peak, with senses subjugate Whereto the clod, the rock, the glistering gold Show all as one. By this sign is he known Being of equal grace to comrades, friends, Chance-comers, strangers, lovers, enemies, Aliens and kinsmen; loving all alike, Evil or good. Sequestered should he sit, Steadfastly meditating, solitary, His thoughts controlled, his passions laid away, Quit of belongings. In a fair, still spot Having his fixed abode,--not too much raised, Nor yet too low,--let him abide, his goods A cloth, a deerskin, and the Kusa-grass.'
p114
aS' There, setting hard his mind upon The One, Restraining heart and senses, silent, calm, Let him accomplish Yoga, and achieve Pureness of soul, holding immovable Body and neck and head, his gaze absorbed Upon his nose-end, rapt from all around, Tranquil in spirit, free of fear, intent Upon his Brahmacharya vow, devout, Musing on Me, lost in the thought of Me.'
p115
aS' That Yojin, so devoted, so controlled, Comes to the peace beyond,--My peace, the peace Of high Nirvana! But for earthly needs Religion is not his who too much fasts Or too much feasts, nor his who sleeps away An idle mind; nor his who wears to waste His strength in vigils. Nay, Arjuna! call That the true piety which most removes Earth-aches and ills, where one is moderate In eating and in resting, and in sport; Measured in wish and act; sleeping betimes, Waking betimes for duty.'
p116
aS" When the man, So living, centres on his soul the thought Straitly restrained--untouched internally By stress of sense--then is he Yukta. See! Steadfast a lamp burns sheltered from the wind; Such is the likeness of the Yogi's mind Shut from sense-storms and burning bright to Heaven."
p117
aS' When mind broods placid, soothed with holy wont; When Self contemplates self, and in itself Hath comfort; when it knows the nameless joy Beyond all scope of sense, revealed to soul-- Only to soul! and, knowing, wavers not, True to the farther Truth; when, holding this, It deems no other treasure comparable, But, harboured there, cannot be stirred or shook By any gravest grief, call that state "peace," That happy severance Yoga; call that man The perfect Yogin!'
p118
aS" Steadfastly the will Must toil thereto, till efforts end in ease, And thought has passed from thinking. Shaking off All longings bred by dreams of fame and gain, Shutting the doorways of the senses close With watchful ward; so, step by step, it comes To gift of peace assured and heart assuaged, When the mind dwells self-wrapped, and the soul broods Cumberless. But, as often as the heart Breaks--wild and wavering--from control, so oft Let him re-curb it, let him rein it back To the soul's governance; for perfect bliss Grows only in the bosom tranquillised, The spirit passionless, purged from offence, Vowed to the Infinite. He who thus vows His soul to the Supreme Soul, quitting sin, Passes unhindered to the endless bliss Of unity with Brahma. He so vowed, So blended, sees the Life-Soul resident In all things living, and all living things In that Life-Soul contained. And whoso thus Discerneth Me in all, and all in Me, I never let him go; nor looseneth he Hold upon Me; but, dwell he where he may, Whate'er his life, in Me he dwells and lives, Because he knows and worships Me, Who dwell In all which lives, and cleaves to Me in all."
p119
aS' Arjuna! if a man sees everywhere-- Taught by his own similitude--one Life, One Essence in the Evil and the Good, Hold him a Yogi, yea! well-perfected!'
p120
aS" Arjuna. Slayer of Madhu! yet again, this Yog, This Peace, derived from equanimity, Made known by thee--I see no fixity Therein, no rest, because the heart of men Is unfixed, Krishna! rash, tumultuous, Wilful and strong. It were all one, I think, To hold the wayward wind, as tame man's heart."
p121
aS" Krishna. Hero long-armed! beyond denial, hard Man's heart is to restrain, and wavering; Yet may it grow restrained by habit, Prince! By wont of self-command. This Yog, I say, Cometh not lightly to th' ungoverned ones; But he who will be master of himself Shall win it, if he stoutly strive thereto."
p122
aS" Arjuna. And what road goeth he who, having faith, Fails, Krishna! in the striving; falling back From holiness, missing the perfect rule? Is he not lost, straying from Brahma's light, Like the vain cloud, which floats 'twixt earth and heaven When lightning splits it, and it vanisheth? Fain would I hear thee answer me herein, Since, Krishna! none save thou can clear the doubt."
p123
aS" Krishna. He is not lost, thou Son of Pritha! No! Nor earth, nor heaven is forfeit, even for him, Because no heart that holds one right desire Treadeth the road of loss! He who should fail, Desiring righteousness, cometh at death Unto the Region of the Just; dwells there Measureless years, and being born anew, Beginneth life again in some fair home Amid the mild and happy. It may chance He doth descend into a Yogin house On Virtue's breast; but that is rare! Such birth Is hard to be obtained on this earth, Chief! So hath he back again what heights of heart He did achieve, and so he strives anew To perfectness, with better hope, dear Prince! For by the old desire he is drawn on Unwittingly; and only to desire The purity of Yog is to pass Beyond the Sabdabrahm, the spoken Ved."
p124
aS' But, being Yogi, striving strong and long, Purged from transgressions, perfected by births Following on births, he plants his feet at last Upon the farther path. Such as one ranks Above ascetics, higher than the wise, Beyond achievers of vast deeds! Be thou Yogi Arjuna! And of such believe, Truest and best is he who worships Me With inmost soul, stayed on My Mystery!'
p125
aS' Krishna. Learn now, dear Prince! how, if thy soul be set Ever on Me--still exercising Yog, Still making Me thy Refuge--thou shalt come Most surely unto perfect hold of Me.'
p126
aS' I will declare to thee that utmost lore, Whole and particular, which, when thou knowest, Leaveth no more to know here in this world. Of many thousand mortals, one, perchance, Striveth for Truth; and of those few that strive-- Nay, and rise high--one only--here and there-- Knoweth Me, as I am, the very Truth.'
p127
aS" Earth, water, flame, air, ether, life, and mind, And individuality--those eight Make up the showing of Me, Manifest. These be my lower Nature; learn the higher, Whereby, thou Valiant One! this Universe Is, by its principle of life, produced; Whereby the worlds of visible things are born As from a Yoni. Know! I am that womb: I make and I unmake this Universe: Than me there is no other Master, Prince! No other Maker! All these hang on me As hangs a row of pearls upon its string. I am the fresh taste of the water; I The silver of the moon, the gold o' the sun, The word of worship in the Veds, the thrill That passeth in the ether, and the strength Of man's shed seed. I am the good sweet smell Of the moistened earth, I am the fire's red light, The vital air moving in all which moves, The holiness of hallowed souls, the root Undying, whence hath sprung whatever is;"
p128
aS" The wisdom of the wise, the intellect Of the informed, the greatness of the great. The splendour of the splendid. Kunti's Son! These am I, free from passion and desire; Yet am I right desire in all who yearn, Chief of the Bharatas! for all those moods, Soothfast, or passionate, or ignorant, Which Nature frames, deduce from me; but all Are merged in me--not I in them! The world-- Deceived by those three qualities of being-- Wotteth not Me Who am outside them all, Above them all, Eternal! Hard it is To pierce that veil divine of various shows Which hideth Me; yet they who worship Me Pierce it and pass beyond."
p129
aS' I am not known To evil-doers, nor to foolish ones, Nor to the base and churlish; nor to those Whose mind is cheated by the show of things, Nor those that take the way of Asuras. Four sorts of mortals know me: he who weeps,'
p130
aS' Arjuna! and the man who yearns to know; And he who toils to help; and he who sits Certain of me, enlightened. Of these four, O Prince of India! highest, nearest, best That last is, the devout soul, wise, intent Upon "The One." Dear, above all, am I To him; and he is dearest unto me!'
p131
aS' All four are good, and seek me; but mine own, The true of heart, the faithful--stayed on me, Taking me as their utmost blessedness, They are not "mine,"but I--even I myself!'
p132
aS' At end of many births to Me they come! Yet hard the wise Mahatma is to find, That man who sayeth, "All is Vasudev!" There be those, too, whose knowledge, turned aside By this desire or that, gives them to serve Some lower gods, with various rites, constrained By that which mouldeth them. Unto all such-- Worship what shrine they will, what shapes, in faith-- \'Tis I who give them faith! I am content!'
p133
aS" The heart thus asking favour from its God, Darkened but ardent, hath the end it craves, The lesser blessing--but 'tis I who give! Yet soon is withered what small fruit they reap: Those men of little minds, who worship so, Go where they worship, passing with their gods."
p134
aS" But Mine come unto me! Blind are the eyes Which deem th' Unmanifested manifest, Not comprehending Me in my true Self! Imperishable, viewless, undeclared, Hidden behind my magic veil of shows, I am not seen by all; I am not known-- Unborn and changeless--to the idle world."
p135
aS' But I, Arjuna! know all things which were, And all which are, and all which are to be, Albeit not one among them knoweth Me! By passion for the "pairs of opposites," By those twain snares of Like and Dislike, Prince!'
p136
aS' All creatures live bewildered, save some few Who, quit of sins, holy in act, informed, Freed from the "opposites,"and fixed in faith, Cleave unto Me. Who cleave, who seek in Me Refuge from birth and death, those have the Truth!'
p137
aS' Those know Me BRAHMA; know Me Soul of Souls, The ADHYATMAN; know KARMA, my work; Know I am ADHIBHUTA, Lord of Life, And ADHIDAIVA, Lord of all the Gods, And ADHIYAJNA, Lord of Sacrifice; Worship Me well, with hearts of love and faith, And find and hold me in the hour of death.'
p138
aS' Arjuna. Who is that BRAHMA? What that Soul of Souls, The ADHYATMAN? What, Thou Best of All! Thy work, the KARMA? Tell me what it is Thou namest ADHIBHUTA? What again Means ADHIDAIVA? Yea, and how it comes Thou canst be ADHIYAJNA in thy flesh? Slayer of Madhu! Further, make me know How good men find thee in the hour of death?'
p139
aS" Krishna. I BRAHMA am! the One Eternal GOD, And ADHYATMAN is My Being's name, The Soul of Souls! What goeth forth from Me, Causing all life to live, is KARMA called: And, Manifested in divided forms, I am the ADHIBHUTA, Lord of Lives; And ADHIDAIVA, Lord of all the Gods, Because I am PURUSHA, who begets. And ADHIYAJNA, Lord of Sacrifice, I--speaking with thee in this body here-- Am, thou embodied one! (for all the shrines Flame unto Me!) And, at the hour of death, He that hath meditated Me alone, In putting off his flesh, comes forth to Me, Enters into My Being--doubt thou not!"
p140
aS" But, if he meditated otherwise At hour of death, in putting off the flesh, He goes to what he looked for, Kunti's Son! Because the Soul is fashioned to its like."
p141
aS' Have Me, then, in thy heart always! and fight! Thou too, when heart and mind are fixed on Me, Shalt surely come to Me! All come who cleave With never-wavering will of firmest faith, Owning none other Gods: all come to Me, The Uttermost, Purusha, Holiest!'
p142
aS" Whoso hath known Me, Lord of sage and singer, Ancient of days; of all the Three Worlds Stay, Boundless,--but unto every atom Bringer Of that which quickens it: whoso, I say, Hath known My form, which passeth mortal knowing; Seen my effulgence--which no eye hath seen-- Than the sun's burning gold more brightly glowing, Dispersing darkness,--unto him hath been Right life! And, in the hour when life is ending, With mind set fast and trustful piety, Drawing still breath beneath calm brows unbending, In happy peace that faithful one doth die,-- In glad peace passeth to Purusha's heaven."
p143
aS' The place which they who read the Vedas name AKSHARAM, "Ultimate;" whereto have striven Saints and ascetics--their road is the same. That way--the highest way--goes he who shuts The gates of all his senses, locks desire Safe in his heart, centres the vital airs Upon his parting thought, steadfastly set; And, murmuring OM, the sacred syllable-- Emblem of BRAHM--dies, meditating Me.'
p144
aS' For who, none other Gods regarding, looks Ever to Me, easily am I gained By such a Yogi; and, attaining Me, They fall not--those Mahatmas--back to birth, To life, which is the place of pain, which ends, But take the way of utmost blessedness.'
p145
aS" The worlds, Arjuna!--even Brahma's world-- Roll back again from Death to Life's unrest; But they, O Kunti's Son! that reach to Me, Taste birth no more. If ye know Brahma's Day Which is a thousand Yugas; if ye know The thousand Yugas making Brahma's Night, Then know ye Day and Night as He doth know! When that vast Dawn doth break, th' Invisible Is brought anew into the Visible; When that deep Night doth darken, all which is Fades back again to Him Who sent it forth; Yea! this vast company of living things-- Again and yet again produced--expires At Brahma's Nightfall; and, at Brahma's Dawn, Riseth, without its will, to life new-born."
p146
aS' But--higher, deeper, innermost--abides Another Life, not like the life of sense, Escaping sight, unchanging. This endures When all created things have passed away: This is that Life named the Unmanifest, The Infinite! the All! the Uttermost.'
p147
aS' Thither arriving none return. That Life Is Mine, and I am there! And, Prince! by faith Which wanders not, there is a way to come Thither. I, the PURUSHA, I Who spread The Universe around me--in Whom dwell All living Things--may so be reached and seen! Richer than holy fruit on Vedas growing, Greater than gifts, better than prayer or fast, Such wisdom is! The Yogi, this way knowing, Comes to the Utmost Perfect Peace at last.'
p148
aS' Krishna. Now will I open unto thee--whose heart Rejects not--that last lore, deepest-concealed, That farthest secret of My Heavens and Earths, Which but to know shall set thee free from ills,-- A royal lore! a Kingly mystery! Yea! for the soul such light as purgeth it From every sin; a light of holiness With inmost splendour shining; plain to see; Easy to walk by, inexhaustible! They that receive not this, failing in faith To grasp the greater wisdom, reach not Me, Destroyer of thy foes! They sink anew Into the realm of Flesh, where all things change! By Me the whole vast Universe of things Is spread abroad;--by Me, the Unmanifest! In Me are all existences contained; Not I in them! Yet they are not contained, Those visible things! Receive and strive to embrace The mystery majestical! My Being-- Creating all, sustaining all--still dwells Outside of all!'
p149
aS' See! as the shoreless airs Move in the measureless space, but are not space, [And space were space without the moving airs]; So all things are in Me, but are not I. At closing of each Kalpa, Indian Prince! All things which be back to My Being come: At the beginning of each Kalpa, all Issue new-born from Me.'
p150
aS' By Energy And help of Prakriti my outer Self, Again, and yet again, I make go forth The realms of visible things--without their will-- All of them--by the power of Prakriti. '
p151
aS' Yet these great makings, Prince! involve Me not Enchain Me not! I sit apart from them, Other, and Higher, and Free; nowise attached! Thus doth the stuff of worlds, moulded by Me, Bring forth all that which is, moving or still, Living or lifeless! Thus the worlds go on! The minds untaught mistake Me, veiled in form;-- Naught see they of My secret Presence, nought Of My hid Nature, ruling all which lives.'
p152
aS" Vain hopes pursuing, vain deeds doing; fed On vainest knowledge, senselessly they seek An evil way, the way of brutes and fiends. But My Mahatmas, those of noble soul Who tread the path celestial, worship Me With hearts unwandeing,--knowing Me the Source, Th' Eternal Source, of Life. Unendingly They glorify Me; seek Me; keep their vows Of reverence and love, with changeless faith Adoring Me. Yea, and those too adore, Who, offering sacrifice of wakened hearts, Have sense of one pervading Spirit's stress, One Force in every place, though manifold! I am the Sacrifice! I am the Prayer!"
p153
aS" I am the Funeral-Cake set for the dead! I am the healing herb! I am the ghee, The Mantra, and the flame, and that which burns! I am-of all this boundless Universe- The Father, Mother, Ancestor, and Guard! The end of Learning! That which purifies In lustral water! I am OM! I am Rig-Veda, Sama-Veda, Yajur-Ved; The Way, the Fosterer, the Lord, the Judge, The Witness; the Abode, the Refuge-House, The Friend, the Fountain and the Sea of Life Which sends, and swallows up; Treasure of Worlds And Treasure-Chamber! Seed and Seed-Sower, Whence endless harvests spring! Sun's heat is mine; Heaven's rain is mine to grant or to withhold; Death am I, and Immortal Life I am,"
p154
aS" Arjuna! SAT and ASAT, Visible Life, And Life Invisible! Yea! those who learn The threefold Veds, who drink the Soma-wine, Purge sins, pay sacrifice--from Me they earn Passage to Swarga; where the meats divine Of great gods feed them in high Indra's heaven."
p155
aS" Yet they, when that prodigious joy is o'er, Paradise spent, and wage for merits given, Come to the world of death and change once more. They had their recompense! they stored their treasure, Following the threefold Scripture and its writ; Who seeketh such gaineth the fleeting pleasure Of joy which comes and goes! I grant them it!"
p156
aS" But to those blessed ones who worship Me, Turning not otherwhere, with minds set fast, I bring assurance of full bliss beyond. Nay, and of hearts which follow other gods In simple faith, their prayers arise to me, O Kunti's Son! though they pray wrongfully; For I am the Receiver and the Lord Of every sacrifice, which these know not Rightfully; so they fall to earth again! "
p157
aS" Who follow gods go to their gods; who vow Their souls to Pitris go to Pitris; minds To evil Bhuts given o'er sink to the Bhuts; And whoso loveth Me cometh to Me. Whoso shall offer Me in faith and love A leaf, a flower, a fruit, water poured forth, That offering I accept, lovingly made With pious will. Whate'er thou doest, Prince!"
p158
aS' Eating or sacrificing, giving gifts, Praying or fasting, let it all be done For Me, as Mine. So shalt thou free thyself From Karmabandh, the chain which holdeth men To good and evil issue, so shalt come Safe unto Me-when thou art quit of flesh-- By faith and abdication joined to Me! I am alike for all! I know not hate, I know not favour! What is made is Mine! But them that worship Me with love, I love; They are in Me, and I in them!'
p159
aS' Nay, Prince! If one of evil life turn in his thought Straightly to Me, count him amidst the good; He hath the high way chosen; he shall grow Righteous ere long; he shall attain that peace Which changes not. Thou Prince of India! Be certain none can perish, trusting Me!'
p160
aS" O Pritha's Son! whoso will turn to Me, Though they be born from the very womb of Sin, Woman or man; sprung of the Vaisya caste Or lowly disregarded Sudra,--all Plant foot upon the highest path; how then The holy Brahmans and My Royal Saints? Ah! ye who into this ill world are come-- Fleeting and false--set your faith fast on Me! Fix heart and thought on Me! Adore Me! Bring Offerings to Me! Make Me prostrations! Make Me your supremest joy! and, undivided, Unto My rest your spirits shall be guided."
p161
aS" Krishna. Hear farther yet, thou Long-Armed Lord! these latest words I say-- Uttered to bring thee bliss and peace, who lovest Me alway-- Not the great company of gods nor kingly Rishis know My Nature, Who have made the gods and Rishis long ago; He only knoweth-only he is free of sin, and wise, Who seeth Me, Lord of the Worlds, with faith-enlightened eyes, Unborn, undying, unbegun. Whatever Natures be To mortal men distributed, those natures spring from Me! Intellect, skill, enlightenment, endurance, self-control, Truthfulness, equability, and grief or joy of soul, And birth and death, and fearfulness, and fearlessness, and shame, And honour, and sweet harmlessness, and peace which is the same Whate'er befalls, and mirth, and tears, and piety, and thrift, And wish to give, and will to help,--all cometh of My gift! "
p162
aS" The Seven Chief Saints, the Elders Four, the Lordly Manus set-- Sharing My work--to rule the worlds, these too did I beget; And Rishis, Pitris, Manus, all, by one thought of My mind; Thence did arise, to fill this world, the races of mankind; Wherefrom who comprehends My Reign of mystic Majesty-- That truth of truths--is thenceforth linked in faultless faith to Me: Yea! knowing Me the source of all, by Me all creatures wrought, The wise in spirit cleave to Me, into My Being brought; Hearts fixed on Me; breaths breathed to Me; praising Me, each to each, So have they happiness and peace, with pious thought and speech; And unto these--thus serving well, thus loving ceaselessly-- I give a mind of perfect mood, whereby they draw to Me; And, all for love of them, within their darkened souls I dwell, And, with bright rays of wisdom's lamp, their ignorance dispel."
p163
aS' Arjuna. Yes! Thou art Parabrahm! The High Abode! The Great Purification! Thou art God Eternal, All-creating, Holy, First, Without beginning! Lord of Lords and Gods!'
p164
aS' Declared by all the Saints--by Narada, Vyasa Asita, and Devalas; And here Thyself declaring unto me! What Thou hast said now know I to be truth, O Kesava! that neither gods nor men Nor demons comprehend Thy mystery Made manifest, Divinest! Thou Thyself '
p165
aS' Thyself alone dost know, Maker Supreme! Master of all the living! Lord of Gods! King of the Universe! To Thee alone Belongs to tell the heavenly excellence Of those perfections wherewith Thou dost fill These worlds of Thine; Pervading, Immanent!'
p166
aS' How shall I learn, Supremest Mystery! To know Thee, though I muse continually? Under what form of Thine unnumbered forms Mayst Thou be grasped? Ah! yet again recount, Clear and complete, Thy great appearances, The secrets of Thy Majesty and Might, Thou High Delight of Men! Never enough Can mine ears drink the Amrit of such words!'
p167
aS" Krishna. Hanta! So be it! Kuru Prince! I will to thee unfold Some portions of My Majesty, whose powers are manifold!

p171
aS" Of poets Usana, of saints Vyasa, sage divine; The policy of conquerors, the potency of kings, The great unbroken silence in learning's secret things; The lore of all the learned, the seed of all which springs. Living or lifeless, still or stirred, whatever beings be, None of them is in all the worlds, but it exists by Me! Nor tongue can tell, Arjuna! nor end of telling come Of these My boundless glories, whereof I teach thee some; For wheresoe'er is wondrous work, and majesty, and might, From Me hath all proceeded. Receive thou this aright! Yet how shouldst thou receive, O Prince! the vastness of this word? I, who am all, and made it all, abide its separate Lord!"
p172
aS" Arjuna. This, for my soul's peace, have I heard from Thee, The unfolding of the Mystery Supreme Named Adhyatman; comprehending which, My darkness is dispelled; for now I know-- O Lotus-eyed!--whence is the birth of men, And whence their death, and what the majesties Of Thine immortal rule. Fain would I see, As thou Thyself declar'st it, Sovereign Lord! The likeness of that glory of Thy Form Wholly revealed. O Thou Divinest One!

Behold! this is the Universe!--Look! what is live and dead I gather all in one--in Me! Gaze, as thy lips have said, On GOD ETERNAL, VERY GOD! See Me! see what thou prayest! Thou canst not!--nor, with human eyes, Arjuna! ever mayest! Therefore I give thee sense divine. Have other eyes, new light! And, look! This is My glory, unveiled to mortal sight!'
p174
aS" Sanjaya. Then, O King! the God, so saying, Stood, to Pritha's Son displaying All the splendour, wonder, dread Of His vast Almighty-head. Out of countless eyes beholding, Out of countless mouths commanding, Countless mystic forms enfolding In one Form: supremely standing Countless radiant glories wearing, Countless heavenly weapons bearing, Crowned with garlands of star-clusters, Robed in garb of woven lustres, Breathing from His perfect Presence Breaths of every subtle essence Of all heavenly odours; shedding Blinding brilliance; overspreading-- Boundless, beautiful--all spaces With His all-regarding faces; So He showed! If there should rise Suddenly within the skies Sunburst of a thousand suns Flooding earth with beams undeemed-of, Then might be that Holy One's Majesty and radiance dreamed of! "
p175
aS" So did Pandu's Son behold All this universe enfold All its huge diversity Into one vast shape, and be Visible, and viewed, and blended In one Body--subtle, splendid, Nameless--th' All-comprehending God of Gods, the Never-Ending Deity!"
p176
aS" But, sore amazed, Thrilled, o'erfilled, dazzled, and dazed, Arjuna knelt; and bowed his head, And clasped his palms; and cried, and said:"
p177
aS" Arjuna. Yea! I have seen! I see! Lord! all is wrapped in Thee! The gods are in Thy glorious frame! the creatures Of earth, and heaven, and hell In Thy Divine form dwell, And in Thy countenance shine all the features Of Brahma, sitting lone Upon His lotus-throne; Of saints and sages, and the serpent races Ananta, Vasuki; Yea! mightiest Lord! I see Thy thousand thousand arms, and breasts, and faces, And eyes,--on every side Perfect, diversified; And nowhere end of Thee, nowhere beginning, Nowhere a centre! Shifts-- Wherever soul's gaze lifts-- Thy central Self, all-wielding, and all-winning!"
p178
aS" Infinite King! I see The anadem on Thee, The club, the shell, the discus; see Thee burning In beams insufferable, Lighting earth, heaven, and hell With brilliance blazing, glowing, flashing; turning Darkness to dazzling day, Look I whichever way; Ah, Lord! I worship Thee, the Undivided, The Uttermost of thought, The Treasure-Palace wrought To hold the wealth of the worlds; the Shield provided To shelter Virtue's laws; The Fount whence Life's stream draws All waters of all rivers of all being: The One Unborn, Unending: Unchanging and Unblending!"
p179
aS' With might and majesty, past thought, past seeing! Silver of moon and gold Of sun are glories rolled From Thy great eyes; Thy visage, beaming tender Throughout the stars and skies, Doth to warm life surprise Thy Universe. The worlds are filled with wonder Of Thy perfections! Space Star-sprinkled, and void place From pole to pole of the Blue, from bound to bound, Hath Thee in every spot, Thee, Thee!--Where Thou art not, O Holy, Marvellous Form! is nowhere found!'
p180
aS' O Mystic, Awful One! At sight of Thee, made known, The Three Worlds quake; the lower gods draw nigh Thee; They fold their palms, and bow Body, and breast, and brow, And, whispering worship, laud and magnify Thee! Rishis and Siddhas cry "Hail! Highest Majesty!"'
p181
aS" From sage and singer breaks the hymn of glory In dulcet harmony, Sounding the praise of Thee; While countless companies take up the story, Rudras, who ride the storms, Th' Adityas' shining forms, Vasus and Sadhyas, Viswas, Ushmapas; Maruts, and those great Twins The heavenly, fair, Aswins, Gandharvas, Rakshasas, Siddhas, and Asuras,-- These see Thee, and revere In sudden-stricken fear;"
p182
aS' Yea! the Worlds,--seeing Thee with form stupendous, With faces manifold, With eyes which all behold, Unnumbered eyes, vast arms, members tremendous, Flanks, lit with sun and star, Feet planted near and far, Tushes of terror, mouths wrathful and tender;-- The Three wide Worlds before Thee Adore, as I adore Thee, Quake, as I quake, to witness so much splendour!'
p183
aS' I mark Thee strike the skies With front, in wondrous wise Huge, rainbow-painted, glittering; and thy mouth Opened, and orbs which see All things, whatever be In all Thy worlds, east, west, and north and south. O Eyes of God! O Head!'
p184
aS" My strength of soul is fled, Gone is heart's force, rebuked is mind's desire! When I behold Thee so, With awful brows a-glow, With burning glance, and lips lighted by fire Fierce as those flames which shall Consume, at close of all, Earth, Heaven! Ah me! I see no Earth and Heaven!"
p185
aS" Thee, Lord of Lords! I see, Thee only-only Thee! Now let Thy mercy unto me be given, Thou Refuge of the World! Lo! to the cavern hurled Of Thy wide-opened throat, and lips white-tushed, I see our noblest ones, Great Dhritarashtra's sons, Bhishma, Drona, and Karna, caught and crushed!"
p186
aS" The Kings and Chiefs drawn in, That gaping gorge within; The best of both these armies torn and riven! Between Thy jaws they lie Mangled full bloodily, Ground into dust and death! Like streams down-driven With helpless haste, which go In headlong furious flow Straight to the gulfing deeps of th' unfilled ocean, So to that flaming cave Those heroes great and brave Pour, in unending streams, with helpless motion!"
p187
aS' Like moths which in the night Flutter towards a light, Drawn to their fiery doom, flying and dying, So to their death still throng, Blind, dazzled, borne along Ceaselessly, all those multitudes, wild flying! Thou, that hast fashioned men, Devourest them again, One with another, great and small, alike!'
p188
aS" The creatures whom Thou mak'st, With flaming jaws Thou tak'st, Lapping them up! Lord God! Thy terrors strike From end to end of earth, Filling life full, from birth To death, with deadly, burning, lurid dread! Ah, Vishnu! make me know Why is Thy visage so? Who art Thou, feasting thus upon Thy dead? Who? awful Deity! I bow myself to Thee, Namostu Te, Devavara! Prasid! O Mightiest Lord! rehearse Why hast Thou face so fierce? Whence doth this aspect horrible proceed?"
p189
aS" Krishna. Thou seest Me as Time who kills, Time who brings all to doom, The Slayer Time, Ancient of Days, come hither to consume; Excepting thee, of all these hosts of hostile chiefs arrayed, There stands not one shall leave alive the battlefield! Dismayed No longer be! Arise! obtain renown! destroy thy foes! Fight for the kingdom waiting thee when thou hast vanquished those. By Me they fall--not thee! the stroke of death is dealt them now, Even as they show thus gallantly; My instrument art thou! Strike, strong-armed Prince, at Drona! at Bhishma strike! deal death On Karna, Jyadratha; stay all their warlike breath! 'Tis I who bid them perish! Thou wilt but slay the slain; Fight! they must fall, and thou must live, victor upon this plain!"
p190
aS" Sanjaya. Hearing mighty Keshav's word, Tremblingly that helmed Lord Clasped his lifted palms, and--praying Grace of Krishna--stood there, saying, With bowed brow and accents broken, These words, timorously spoken:"
p191
aS' Arjuna. Worthily, Lord of Might! The whole world hath delight In Thy surpassing power, obeying Thee; The Rakshasas, in dread At sight of Thee, are sped To all four quarters; and the company Of Siddhas sound Thy name. How should they not proclaim Thy Majesties, Divinest, Mightiest? Thou Brahm, than Brahma greater! Thou Infinite Creator! '
p192
aS" Thou God of gods, Life's Dwelling-place and Rest! Thou, of all souls the Soul! The Comprehending Whole! Of being formed, and formless being the Framer; O Utmost One! O Lord! Older than eld, Who stored The worlds with wealth of life! O Treasure-Claimer, Who wottest all, and art Wisdom Thyself! O Part In all, and All; for all from Thee have risen Numberless now I see"
p193
aS" The aspects are of Thee! Vayu Thou art, and He who keeps the prison Of Narak, Yama dark; And Agni's shining spark; Varuna's waves are Thy waves. Moon and starlight Are Thine! Prajapati Art Thou, and 'tis to Thee They knelt in worshipping the old world's far light, The first of mortal men."
p194
aS' Again, Thou God! again A thousand thousand times be magnified! Honour and worship be-- Glory and praise,--to Thee Namo, Namaste, cried on every side; Cried here, above, below, Uttered when Thou dost go, Uttered where Thou dost come! Namo! we call; Namostu! God adored! Namostu! Nameless Lord! Hail to Thee! Praise to Thee! Thou One in all; For Thou art All! Yea, Thou!'
p195
aS' Ah! if in anger now Thou shouldst remember I did think Thee Friend, Speaking with easy speech, As men use each to each; Did call Thee "Krishna," "Prince," nor comprehend Thy hidden majesty, The might, the awe of Thee; Did, in my heedlessness, or in my love, On journey, or in jest, Or when we lay at rest, Sitting at council, straying in the grove, Alone, or in the throng, Do Thee, most Holy! wrong, Be Thy grace granted for that witless sin!'
p196
aS' For Thou art, now I know, Father of all below, Of all above, of all the worlds within Guru of Gurus; more To reverence and adore Than all which is adorable and high! '
p197
aS' How, in the wide worlds three Should any equal be? Should any other share Thy Majesty? Therefore, with body bent And reverent intent, I praise, and serve, and seek Thee, asking grace.'
p198
aS" As father to a son, As friend to friend, as one Who loveth to his lover, turn Thy face In gentleness on me! Good is it I did see This unknown marvel of Thy Form! But fear Mingles with joy! Retake, Dear Lord! for pity's sake Thine earthly shape, which earthly eyes may bear!"
p199
aS' Be merciful, and show The visage that I know; Let me regard Thee, as of yore, arrayed With disc and forehead-gem, With mace and anadem, Thou that sustainest all things! Undismayed Let me once more behold The form I loved of old, Thou of the thousand arms and countless eyes!'
p200
aS" This frightened heart is fain To see restored again My Charioteer, in Krishna's kind disguise."
p201
aS' Krishna. Yea! thou hast seen, Arjuna! because I loved thee well, The secret countenance of Me, revealed by mystic spell, Shining, and wonderful, and vast, majestic, manifold, Which none save thou in all the years had favour to behold;'
p202
aS' For not by Vedas cometh this, nor sacrifice, nor alms, Nor works well-done, nor penance long, nor prayers, nor chaunted psalms, That mortal eyes should bear to view the Immortal Soul unclad, Prince of the Kurus! This was kept for thee alone! Be glad!'
p203
aS" Let no more trouble shake thy heart, because thine eyes have seen My terror with My glory. As I before have been So will I be again for thee; with lightened heart behold! Once more I am thy Krishna, the form thou knew'st of old!"
p204
aS" Sanjaya. These words to Arjuna spake Vasudev, and straight did take Back again the semblance dear Of the well-loved charioteer; Peace and joy it did restore When the Prince beheld once more Mighty BRAHMA's form and face Clothed in Krishna's gentle grace."
p205
aS' Arjuna. Now that I see come back, Janardana! This friendly human frame, my mind can think Calm thoughts once more; my heart beats still again!'
p206
aS' Krishna. Yea! it was wonderful and terrible To view me as thou didst, dear Prince! The gods Dread and desire continually to view! Yet not by Vedas, nor from sacrifice, Nor penance, nor gift-giving, nor with prayer Shall any so behold, as thou hast seen!'
p207
aS" Only by fullest service, perfect faith, And uttermost surrender am I known And seen, and entered into, Indian Prince! Who doeth all for Me; who findeth Me In all; adoreth always; loveth all Which I have made, and Me, for Love's sole end That man, Arjuna! unto Me doth wend."
p208
aS' Arjuna. Lord! of the men who serve Thee--true in heart-- As God revealed; and of the men who serve, Worshipping Thee Unrevealed, Unbodied, Far, Which take the better way of faith and life?'
p209
aS' Krishna. Whoever serve Me--as I show Myself-- Constantly true, in full devotion fixed, Those hold I very holy. But who serve-- Worshipping Me The One, The Invisible, The Unrevealed, Unnamed, Unthinkable, Uttermost, All-pervading, Highest, Sure-- Who thus adore Me, mastering their sense, Of one set mind to all, glad in all good, These blessed souls come unto Me.'
p210
aS" Yet, hard The travail is for such as bend their minds To reach th' Unmanifest That viewless path Shall scarce be trod by man bearing the flesh! But whereso any doeth all his deeds Renouncing self for Me, full of Me, fixed To serve only the Highest, night and day Musing on Me--him will I swiftly lift Forth from life's ocean of distress and death, Whose soul clings fast to Me. Cling thou to Me!"
p211
aS" Clasp Me with heart and mind! so shalt thou dwell Surely with Me on high. But if thy thought Droops from such height; if thou be'st weak to set Body and soul upon Me constantly, Despair not! give Me lower service! seek To reach Me, worshipping with steadfast will; And, if thou canst not worship steadfastly, Work for Me, toil in works pleasing to Me!"
p212
aS' For he that laboureth right for love of Me Shall finally attain! But, if in this Thy faint heart fails, bring Me thy failure! find Refuge in Me! let fruits of labour go, Renouncing hope for Me, with lowliest heart, So shalt thou come; for, though to know is more Than diligence, yet worship better is Than knowing, and renouncing better still.'
p213
aS' Near to renunciation--very near-- Dwelleth Eternal Peace! Who hateth nought Of all which lives, living himself benign, Compassionate, from arrogance exempt, Exempt from love of self, unchangeable By good or ill; patient, contented, firm In faith, mastering himself, true to his word, Seeking Me, heart and soul; vowed unto Me,-- That man I love! Who troubleth not his kind, And is not troubled by them; clear of wrath, Living too high for gladness, grief, or fear, That man I love! Who, dwelling quiet-eyed, Stainless, serene, well-balanced, unperplexed, Working with Me, yet from all works detached, That man I love! Who, fixed in faith on Me, Dotes upon none, scorns none; rejoices not, And grieves not, letting good or evil hap Light when it will, and when it will depart, That man I love! Who, unto friend and foe Keeping an equal heart, with equal mind Bears shame and glory; with an equal peace Takes heat and cold, pleasure and pain; abides Quit of desires, hears praise or calumny In passionless restraint, unmoved by each;'
p214
aS" Linked by no ties to earth, steadfast in Me, That man I love! But most of all I love Those happy ones to whom 'tis life to live In single fervid faith and love unseeing, Drinking the blessed Amrit of my Being!"
p215
aS' Arjuna. Now would I hear, O gracious Kesava! Of Life which seems, and Soul beyond, which sees, And what it is we know-or think to know.'
p216
aS' Krishna. Yea! Son of Kunti! for this flesh ye see Is Kshetra, is the field where Life disports; And that which views and knows it is the Soul, Kshetrajna. In all "fields," thou Indian prince! I am Kshetrajna. I am what surveys! '
p217
aS' Only that knowledge knows which knows the known By the knower! What it is, that "field" of life, What qualities it hath, and whence it is, And why it changeth, and the faculty That wotteth it, the mightiness of this, And how it wotteth-hear these things from Me!'
p218
aS' The elements, the conscious life, the mind, The unseen vital force, the nine strange gates Of the body, and the five domains of sense; Desire, dislike, pleasure and pain, and thought Deep-woven, and persistency of being; These all are wrought on Matter by the Soul!'
p219
aS' Humbleness, truthfulness, and harmlessness, Patience and honour, reverence for the wise. Purity, constancy, control of self, Contempt of sense-delights, self-sacrifice, Perception of the certitude of ill In birth, death, age, disease, suffering, and sin; Detachment, lightly holding unto home, Children, and wife, and all that bindeth men; An ever-tranquil heart in fortunes good And fortunes evil, with a will set firm To worship Me--Me only! ceasing not; Loving all solitudes, and shunning noise Of foolish crowds; endeavours resolute To reach perception of the Utmost Soul, And grace to understand what gain it were So to attain,--this is true Wisdom, Prince!'
p220
aS' And what is otherwise is ignorance! Now will I speak of knowledge best to know- That Truth which giveth man Amrit to drink, The Truth of HIM, the Para-Brahm, the All, The Uncreated;; not Asat, not Sat, Not Form, nor the Unformed; yet both, and more;-- Whose hands are everywhere, and everywhere Planted His feet, and everywhere His eyes Beholding, and His ears in every place Hearing, and all His faces everywhere Enlightening and encompassing His worlds.'
p221
aS' Glorified in the senses He hath given, Yet beyond sense He is; sustaining all, Yet dwells He unattached: of forms and modes Master, yet neither form nor mode hath He; He is within all beings--and without-- Motionless, yet still moving; not discerned For subtlety of instant presence; close To all, to each; yet measurelessly far!'
p222
aS" Not manifold, and yet subsisting still In all which lives; for ever to be known As the Sustainer, yet, at the End of Times, He maketh all to end--and re-creates. The Light of Lights He is, in the heart of the Dark Shining eternally. Wisdom He is And Wisdom's way, and Guide of all the wise, Planted in every heart."
p223
aS" So have I told Of Life's stuff, and the moulding, and the lore To comprehend. Whoso, adoring Me, Perceiveth this, shall surely come to Me! Know thou that Nature and the Spirit both Have no beginning! Know that qualities And changes of them are by Nature wrought; That Nature puts to work the acting frame, But Spirit doth inform it, and so cause Feeling of pain and pleasure. Spirit, linked To moulded matter, entereth into bond With qualities by Nature framed, and, thus Married to matter, breeds the birth again In good or evil yonis."
p224
aS' Yet is this Yea! in its bodily prison!--Spirit pure, Spirit supreme; surveying, governing, Guarding, possessing; Lord and Master still PURUSHA, Ultimate, One Soul with Me. '
p225
aS" Whoso thus knows himself, and knows his soul PURUSHA, working through the qualities With Nature's modes, the light hath come for him! Whatever flesh he bears, never again Shall he take on its load. Some few there be By meditation find the Soul in Self Self-schooled; and some by long philosophy And holy life reach thither; some by works: Some, never so attaining, hear of light From other lips, and seize, and cleave to it Worshipping; yea! and those--to teaching true-- Overpass Death!"
p226
aS' Wherever, Indian Prince! Life is--of moving things, or things unmoved, Plant or still seed--know, what is there hath grown By bond of Matter and of Spirit: Know He sees indeed who sees in all alike The living, lordly Soul; the Soul Supreme, Imperishable amid the Perishing: '
p227
aS" For, whoso thus beholds, in every place, In every form, the same, one, Living Life, Doth no more wrongfulness unto himself, But goes the highest road which brings to bliss. Seeing, he sees, indeed, who sees that works Are Nature's wont, for Soul to practise by Acting, yet not the agent; sees the mass Of separate living things--each of its kind-- Issue from One, and blend again to One: Then hath he BRAHMA, he attains!"
p228
aS" O Prince! That Ultimate, High Spirit, Uncreate, Unqualified, even when it entereth flesh Taketh no stain of acts, worketh in nought! Like to the ethereal air, pervading all, Which, for sheer subtlety, avoideth taint, The subtle Soul sits everywhere, unstained: Like to the light of the all-piercing sun [Which is not changed by aught it shines upon,] The Soul's light shineth pure in every place; And they who, by such eye of wisdom, see How Matter, and what deals with it, divide; And how the Spirit and the flesh have strife, Those wise ones go the way which leads to Life!"
p229
aS' Krishna. Yet farther will I open unto thee This wisdom of all wisdoms, uttermost, The which possessing, all My saints have passed To perfectness. On such high verities Reliant, rising into fellowship With Me, they are not born again at birth Of Kalpas, nor at Pralyas suffer change!'
p230
aS' This Universe the womb is where I plant Seed of all lives! Thence, Prince of India, comes Birth to all beings! Whoso, Kunti\'s Son! Mothers each mortal form, Brahma conceives, And I am He that fathers, sending seed! Sattwan, Rajas, and Tamas, so are named The qualities of Nature, "Soothfastness," "Passion," and "Ignorance." These three bind down The changeless Spirit in the changeful flesh. '
p231
aS' Whereof sweet "Soothfastness," by purity Living unsullied and enlightened, binds The sinless Soul to happiness and truth; And Passion, being kin to appetite, And breeding impulse and propensity, Binds the embodied Soul, O Kunti\'s Son! By tie of works. But Ignorance, begot Of Darkness, blinding mortal men, binds down Their souls to stupor, sloth, and drowsiness.'
p232
aS' Yea, Prince of India! Soothfastness binds souls In pleasant wise to flesh; and Passion binds By toilsome strain; but Ignorance, which blots The beams of wisdom, binds the soul to sloth. Passion and Ignorance, once overcome, Leave Soothfastness, O Bharata! Where this With Ignorance are absent, Passion rules; And Ignorance in hearts not good nor quick.'
p233
aS" When at all gateways of the Body shines The Lamp of Knowledge, then may one see well Soothfastness settled in that city reigns; Where longing is, and ardour, and unrest, Impulse to strive and gain, and avarice, Those spring from Passion--Prince!--engrained; and where Darkness and dulness, sloth and stupor are, 'Tis Ignorance hath caused them, Kuru Chief!"
p234
aS' Moreover, when a soul departeth, fixed In Soothfastness, it goeth to the place-- Perfect and pure--of those that know all Truth. If it departeth in set habitude Of Impulse, it shall pass into the world Of spirits tied to works; and, if it dies In hardened Ignorance, that blinded soul Is born anew in some unlighted womb.'
p235
aS' The fruit of Soothfastness is true and sweet; The fruit of lusts is pain and toil; the fruit Of Ignorance is deeper darkness. Yea! For Light brings light, and Passion ache to have; And gloom, bewilderments, and ignorance Grow forth from Ignorance. Those of the first Rise ever higher; those of the second mode Take a mid place; the darkened souls sink back To lower deeps, loaded with witlessness!'
p236
aS' When, watching life, the living man perceives The only actors are the Qualities, And knows what rules beyond the Qualities, Then is he come nigh unto Me!'
p237
aS' The Soul, Thus passing forth from the Three Qualities-- Whereby arise all bodies--overcomes Birth, Death, Sorrow, and Age; and drinketh deep The undying wine of Amrit.'
p238
aS' Arjuna. Oh, my Lord! Which be the signs to know him that hath gone Past the Three Modes? How liveth he? What way Leadeth him safe beyond the threefold Modes?'
p239
aS' Krishna. He who with equanimity surveys Lustre of goodness, strife of passion, sloth Of ignorance, not angry if they are, Not wishful when they are not: he who sits A sojourner and stranger in their midst Unruffled, standing off, saying--serene-- When troubles break, "These be the Qualities!"'
p240
aS' He unto whom--self-centred--grief and joy Sound as one word; to whose deep-seeing eyes The clod, the marble, and the gold are one; Whose equal heart holds the same gentleness For lovely and unlovely things, firm-set, Well-pleased in praise and dispraise; satisfied With honour or dishonour; unto friends And unto foes alike in tolerance; Detached from undertakings,--he is named Surmounter of the Qualities!'
p241
aS' And such-- With single, fervent faith adoring Me, Passing beyond the Qualities, conforms To Brahma, and attains Me! For I am That whereof Brahma is the likeness! Mine The Amrit is; and Immortality Is mine; and mine perfect Felicity!'
p242
aS" Krishna. Men call the Aswattha,--the Banyan-tree,-- Which hath its boughs beneath, its roots above,-- The ever-holy tree. Yea! for its leaves Are green and waving hymns which whisper Truth! Who knows the Aswattha, knows Veds, and all. Its branches shoot to heaven and sink to earth, Even as the deeds of men, which take their birth From qualities: its silver sprays and blooms, And all the eager verdure of its girth, Leap to quick life at kiss of sun and air, As men's lives quicken to the temptings fair Of wooing sense: its hanging rootlets seek The soil beneath, helping to hold it there, As actions wrought amid this world of men Bind them by ever-tightening bonds again."
p243
aS' If ye knew well the teaching of the Tree, What its shape saith; and whence it springs; and, then How it must end, and all the ills of it, The axe of sharp Detachment ye would whet, And cleave the clinging snaky roots, and lay This Aswattha of sense-life low,--to set New growths upspringing to that happier sky,-- Which they who reach shall have no day to die, Nor fade away, nor fall--to Him, I mean, FATHER and FIRST, Who made the mystery Of old Creation; for to Him come they From passion and from dreams who break away;'
p244
aS' Who part the bonds constraining them to flesh, And,--Him, the Highest, worshipping alway-- No longer grow at mercy of what breeze Of summer pleasure stirs the sleeping trees, What blast of tempest tears them, bough and stem To the eternal world pass such as these!'
p245
aS" Another Sun gleams there! another Moon! Another Light,--not Dusk, nor Dawn, nor Noon-- Which they who once behold return no more; They have attained My rest, life's Utmost boon!"
p246
aS" When, in this world of manifested life, The undying Spirit, setting forth from Me, Taketh on form, it draweth to itself From Being's storehouse,--which containeth all,-- Senses and intellect. The Sovereign Soul Thus entering the flesh, or quitting it, Gathers these up, as the wind gathers scents, Blowing above the flower-beds. Ear and Eye, And Touch and Taste, and Smelling, these it takes,-- Yea, and a sentient mind;--linking itself To sense-things so."
p247
aS' The unenlightened ones Mark not that Spirit when he goes or comes, Nor when he takes his pleasure in the form, Conjoined with qualities; but those see plain Who have the eyes to see. Holy souls see Which strive thereto. Enlightened, they perceive That Spirit in themselves; but foolish ones, Even though they strive, discern not, having hearts Unkindled, ill-informed!'
p248
aS' Know, too, from Me Shineth the gathered glory of the suns Which lighten all the world: from Me the moons Draw silvery beams, and fire fierce loveliness. I penetrate the clay, and lend all shapes Their living force; I glide into the plant-- Root, leaf, and bloom--to make the woodlands green With springing sap. Becoming vital warmth, I glow in glad, respiring frames, and pass, With outward and with inward breath, to feed The body by all meats.'
p249
aS' For in this world Being is twofold: the Divided, one; The Undivided, one. All things that live Are "the Divided." That which sits apart, "The Undivided."'
p250
aS' Higher still is He, The Highest, holding all, whose Name is LORD, The Eternal, Sovereign, First! Who fills all worlds, Sustaining them. And--dwelling thus beyond Divided Being and Undivided--I Am called of men and Vedas, Life Supreme, The PURUSHOTTAMA.'
p251
aS' Who knows Me thus, With mind unclouded, knoweth all, dear Prince! And with his whole soul ever worshippeth Me. Now is the sacred, secret Mystery Declared to thee! Who comprehendeth this Hath wisdom! He is quit of works in bliss!'
p252
aS' Krishna. Fearlessness, singleness of soul, the will Always to strive for wisdom; opened hand And governed appetites; and piety, And love of lonely study; humbleness, Uprightness, heed to injure nought which lives, Truthfulness, slowness unto wrath, a mind That lightly letteth go what others prize;'
p253
aS" And equanimity, and charity Which spieth no man's faults; and tenderness Towards all that suffer; a contented heart, Fluttered by no desires; a bearing mild, Modest, and grave, with manhood nobly mixed, With patience, fortitude, and purity;"
p254
aS" An unrevengeful spirit, never given To rate itself too high;--such be the signs, O Indian Prince! of him whose feet are set On that fair path which leads to heavenly birth! Deceitfulness, and arrogance, and pride, Quickness to anger, harsh and evil speech, And ignorance, to its own darkness blind,-- These be the signs, My Prince! of him whose birth Is fated for the regions of the vile. The Heavenly Birth brings to deliverance, So should'st thou know! The birth with Asuras Brings into bondage. Be thou joyous, Prince!"
p255
aS' Whose lot is set apart for heavenly Birth. Two stamps there are marked on all living men, Divine and Undivine; I spake to thee By what marks thou shouldst know the Heavenly Man, Hear from me now of the Unheavenly!'
p256
aS' They comprehend not, the Unheavenly, How Souls go forth from Me; nor how they come Back unto Me: nor is there Truth in these, Nor purity, nor rule of Life. "This world Hath not a Law, nor Order, nor a Lord," So say they: "nor hath risen up by Cause Following on Cause, in perfect purposing, But is none other than a House of Lust." And, this thing thinking, all those ruined ones-- Of little wit, dark-minded--give themselves To evil deeds, the curses of their kind. Surrendered to desires insatiable, Full of deceitfulness, folly, and pride, In blindness cleaving to their errors, caught Into the sinful course, they trust this lie As it were true--this lie which leads to death-- Finding in Pleasure all the good which is, And crying "Here it finisheth!"'
p257
aS' Ensnared In nooses of a hundred idle hopes, Slaves to their passion and their wrath, they buy Wealth with base deeds, to glut hot appetites; "Thus much, to-day," they say, "we gained! thereby Such and such wish of heart shall have its fill; And this is ours! and th\' other shall be ours!'
p258
aS' To-day we slew a foe, and we will slay Our other enemy to-morrow! Look! Are we not lords? Make we not goodly cheer? Is not our fortune famous, brave, and great? Rich are we, proudly born! What other men Live like to us? Kill, then, for sacrifice!'
p259
aS' Cast largesse, and be merry!" So they speak Darkened by ignorance; and so they fall-- Tossed to and fro with projects, tricked, and bound In net of black delusion, lost in lusts-- Down to foul Naraka. Conceited, fond, Stubborn and proud, dead-drunken with the wine Of wealth, and reckless, all their offerings Have but a show of reverence, being not made In piety of ancient faith. Thus vowed To self-hood, force, insolence, feasting, wrath, These My blasphemers, in the forms they wear And in the forms they breed, my foemen are, Hateful and hating; cruel, evil, vile, Lowest and least of men, whom I cast down Again, and yet again, at end of lives, Into some devilish womb, whence--birth by birth-- The devilish wombs re-spawn them, all beguiled; And, till they find and worship Me, sweet Prince!'
p260
aS" Tread they that Nether Road. The Doors of Hell Are threefold, whereby men to ruin pass,-- The door of Lust, the door of Wrath, the door Of Avarice. Let a man shun those three! He who shall turn aside from entering All those three gates of Narak, wendeth straight To find his peace, and comes to Swarga's gate."
p261
aS' Arjuna. If men forsake the holy ordinance, Heedless of Shastras, yet keep faith at heart And worship, what shall be the state of those, Great Krishna! Sattwan, Rajas, Tamas? Say!'
p262
aS' Krishna. Threefold the faith is of mankind and springs From those three qualities,--becoming "true," Or "passion-stained," or "dark," as thou shalt hear! The faith of each believer, Indian Prince!'
p263
aS' Conforms itself to what he truly is. Where thou shalt see a worshipper, that one To what he worships lives assimilate,[Such as the shrine, so is the votary,] The "soothfast" souls adore true gods; the souls Obeying Rajas worship Rakshasas Or Yakshas; and the men of Darkness pray To Pretas and to Bhutas. Yea, and those Who practise bitter penance, not enjoined By rightful rule--penance which hath its root In self-sufficient, proud hypocrisies-- Those men, passion-beset, violent, wild, Torturing--the witless ones--My elements Shut in fair company within their flesh, (Nay, Me myself, present within the flesh!)'
p264
aS' Know them to devils devoted, not to Heaven! For like as foods are threefold for mankind In nourishing, so is there threefold way Of worship, abstinence, and almsgiving!'
p265
aS' Hear this of Me! there is a food which brings Force, substance, strength, and health, and joy to live, Being well-seasoned, cordial, comforting, The "Soothfast" meat. And there be foods which bring Aches and unrests, and burning blood, and grief, Being too biting, heating, salt, and sharp, And therefore craved by too strong appetite.'
p266
aS' And there is foul food--kept from over-night, Savourless, filthy, which the foul will eat, A feast of rottenness, meet for the lips Of such as love the "Darkness."'
p267
aS' Thus with rites;-- A sacrifice not for rewardment made, Offered in rightful wise, when he who vows Sayeth, with heart devout, "This I should do!" Is "Soothfast" rite. But sacrifice for gain, Offered for good repute, be sure that this, O Best of Bharatas! is Rajas-rite, With stamp of "passion." And a sacrifice Offered against the laws, with no due dole Of food-giving, with no accompaniment Of hallowed hymn, nor largesse to the priests, In faithless celebration, call it vile, The deed of "Darkness!"--lost!'
p268
aS" Worship of gods Meriting worship; lowly reverence Of Twice-borns, Teachers, Elders; Purity, Rectitude, and the Brahmacharya's vow, And not to injure any helpless thing,-- "
p269
aS' These make a true religiousness of Act. Words causing no man woe, words ever true, Gentle and pleasing words, and those ye say In murmured reading of a Sacred Writ,-- These make the true religiousness of Speech. Serenity of soul, benignity, Sway of the silent Spirit, constant stress To sanctify the Nature,--these things make Good rite, and true religiousness of Mind.'
p270
aS' Such threefold faith, in highest piety Kept, with no hope of gain, by hearts devote, Is perfect work of Sattwan, true belief. Religion shown in act of proud display To win good entertainment, worship, fame, Such--say I--is of Rajas, rash and vain.'
p271
aS' Religion followed by a witless will To torture self, or come at power to hurt Another,--\'tis of Tamas, dark and ill. The gift lovingly given, when one shall say "Now must I gladly give!" when he who takes Can render nothing back; made in due place, Due time, and to a meet recipient, Is gift of Sattwan, fair and profitable.'
p272
aS' The gift selfishly given, where to receive Is hoped again, or when some end is sought, Or where the gift is proffered with a grudge, This is of Rajas, stained with impulse, ill. The gift churlishly flung, at evil time, In wrongful place, to base recipient, Made in disdain or harsh unkindliness, Is gift of Tamas, dark; it doth not bless!'
p273
aS" Arjuna. Fain would I better know, Thou Glorious One! The very truth- Heart's Lord!--of Sannyas, Abstention; and enunciation, Lord! Tyaga; and what separates these twain!"
p274
aS' Krishna. The poets rightly teach that Sannyas Is the foregoing of all acts which spring Out of desire; and their wisest say Tyaga is renouncing fruit of acts.'
p275
aS' There be among the saints some who have held All action sinful, and to be renounced; And some who answer, "Nay! the goodly acts-- As worship, penance, alms--must be performed!" Hear now My sentence, Best of Bharatas! \'Tis well set forth, O Chaser of thy Foes! Renunciation is of threefold form, And Worship, Penance, Alms, not to be stayed;'
p276
aS' Nay, to be gladly done; for all those three Are purifying waters for true souls! Yet must be practised even those high works In yielding up attachment, and all fruit Produced by works. This is My judgment, Prince! This My insuperable and fixed decree!'
p277
aS' Abstaining from a work by right prescribed Never is meet! So to abstain doth spring From "Darkness," and Delusion teacheth it. Abstaining from a work grievous to flesh, When one saith "\'Tis unpleasing!" this is null! Such an one acts from "passion;" nought of gain Wins his Renunciation! But, Arjun!'
p278
aS' Abstaining from attachment to the work, Abstaining from rewardment in the work, While yet one doeth it full faithfully, Saying, "Tis right to do!" that is "true " act And abstinence! Who doeth duties so, Unvexed if his work fail, if it succeed Unflattered, in his own heart justified, Quit of debates and doubts, his is "true" act:'
p279
aS' For, being in the body, none may stand Wholly aloof from act; yet, who abstains From profit of his acts is abstinent. The fruit of labours, in the lives to come, Is threefold for all men,--Desirable, And Undesirable, and mixed of both; But no fruit is at all where no work was. Hear from me, Long-armed Lord! the makings five Which go to every act, in Sankhya taught As necessary. First the force; and then The agent; next, the various instruments;'
p280
aS' Fourth, the especial effort; fifth, the God. What work soever any mortal doth Of body, mind, or speech, evil or good, By these five doth he that. Which being thus, Whoso, for lack of knowledge, seeth himself As the sole actor, knoweth nought at all And seeth nought. Therefore, I say, if one-- Holding aloof from self--with unstained mind Should slay all yonder host, being bid to slay, He doth not slay; he is not bound thereby!'
p281
aS' Knowledge, the thing known, and the mind which knows, These make the threefold starting-ground of act. The act, the actor, and the instrument, These make the threefold total of the deed.'
p282
aS' But knowledge, agent, act, are differenced By three dividing qualities. Hear now Which be the qualities dividing them. There is "true" Knowledge. Learn thou it is this: To see one changeless Life in all the Lives, And in the Separate, One Inseparable.'
p283
aS' There is imperfect Knowledge: that which sees The separate existences apart, And, being separated, holds them real. There is false Knowledge: that which blindly clings To one as if \'twere all, seeking no Cause, Deprived of light, narrow, and dull, and "dark."'
p284
aS' There is "right" Action: that which being enjoined-- Is wrought without attachment, passionlessly, For duty, not for love, nor hate, nor gain. There is "vain" Action: that which men pursue Aching to satisfy desires, impelled By sense of self, with all-absorbing stress:'
p285
aS' This is of Rajas--passionate and vain. There is "dark" Action: when one doth a thing Heedless of issues, heedless of the hurt Or wrong for others, heedless if he harm His own soul--\'tis of Tamas, black and bad! There is the "rightful"doer. He who acts Free from self-seeking, humble, resolute, Steadfast, in good or evil hap the same, Content to do aright-he "truly" acts.'
p286
aS' There is th\' "impassioned" doer. He that works From impulse, seeking profit, rude and bold To overcome, unchastened; slave by turns Of sorrow and of joy: of Rajas he! And there be evil doers; loose of heart, Low-minded, stubborn, fraudulent, remiss, Dull, slow, despondent--children of the "dark."'
p287
aS' Hear, too, of Intellect and Steadfastness The threefold separation, Conqueror-Prince! How these are set apart by Qualities. Good is the Intellect which comprehends The coming forth and going back of life, What must be done, and what must not be done, What should be feared, and what should not be feared, What binds and what emancipates the soul:'
p288
aS' That is of Sattwan, Prince! of "soothfastness." Marred is the Intellect which, knowing right And knowing wrong, and what is well to do And what must not be done, yet understands Nought with firm mind, nor as the calm truth is: This is of Rajas, Prince! and "passionate!"'
p289
aS' Evil is Intellect which, wrapped in gloom, Looks upon wrong as right, and sees all things Contrariwise of Truth. O Pritha\'s Son! That is of Tamas, "dark" and desperate! Good is the steadfastness whereby a man Masters his beats of heart, his very breath Of life, the action of his senses; fixed In never-shaken faith and piety:'
p290
aS' That is of Sattwan, Prince! "soothfast" and fair! Stained is the steadfastness whereby a man Holds to his duty, purpose, effort, end, For life\'s sake, and the love of goods to gain, Arjuna! \'tis of Rajas, passion-stamped! Sad is the steadfastness wherewith the fool Cleaves to his sloth, his sorrow, and his fears, His folly and despair. This--Pritha\'s Son!-- Is born of Tamas, "dark" and miserable! Hear further, Chief of Bharatas! from Me The threefold kinds of Pleasure which there be.'
p291
aS" Good Pleasure is the pleasure that endures, Banishing pain for aye; bitter at first As poison to the soul, but afterward Sweet as the taste of Amrit. Drink of that! It springeth in the Spirit's deep content. And painful Pleasure springeth from the bond Between the senses and the sense-world. Sweet As Amrit is its first taste, but its last Bitter as poison. 'Tis of Rajas, Prince!"
p292
aS' And foul and "dark" the Pleasure is which springs From sloth and sin and foolishness; at first And at the last, and all the way of life The soul bewildering. \'Tis of Tamas, Prince! For nothing lives on earth, nor \'midst the gods In utmost heaven, but hath its being bound With these three Qualities, by Nature framed.'
p293
aS" The work of Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, And Sudras, O thou Slayer of thy Foes! Is fixed by reason of the Qualities Planted in each: A Brahman's virtues, Prince! Born of his nature, are serenity, Self-mastery, religion, purity, Patience, uprightness, learning, and to know The truth of things which be. A Kshatriya's pride, Born of his nature, lives in valour, fire, Constancy, skilfulness, spirit in fight, And open-handedness and noble mien, As of a lord of men. A Vaisya's task, Born with his nature, is to till the ground, Tend cattle, venture trade. A Sudra's state, Suiting his nature, is to minister. Whoso performeth--diligent, content-- The work allotted him, whate'er it be, Lays hold of perfectness! Hear how a man Findeth perfection, being so content: He findeth it through worship--wrought by work-- Of Him that is the Source of all which lives, Of HIM by Whom the universe was stretched."
p294
aS" Better thine own work is, though done with fault, Than doing others' work, ev'n excellently. He shall not fall in sin who fronts the task Set him by Nature's hand! Let no man leave His natural duty, Prince! though it bear blame! For every work hath blame, as every flame Is wrapped in smoke! Only that man attains Perfect surcease of work whose work was wrought With mind unfettered, soul wholly subdued, Desires for ever dead, results renounced."
p295
aS" Learn from me, Son of Kunti! also this, How one, attaining perfect peace, attains BRAHM, the supreme, the highest height of all! Devoted--with a heart grown pure, restrained In lordly self-control, forgoing wiles Of song and senses, freed from love and hate, Dwelling 'mid solitudes, in diet spare, With body, speech, and will tamed to obey, Ever to holy meditation vowed, From passions liberate, quit of the Self, Of arrogance, impatience, anger, pride;"
p296
aS' Freed from surroundings, quiet, lacking nought-- Such an one grows to oneness with the BRAHM; Such an one, growing one with BRAHM, serene, Sorrows no more, desires no more; his soul, Equally loving all that lives, loves well Me, Who have made them, and attains to Me.'
p297
aS" By this same love and worship doth he know Me as I am, how high and wonderful, And knowing, straightway enters into Me. And whatsoever deeds he doeth--fixed In Me, as in his refuge--he hath won For ever and for ever by My grace Th' Eternal Rest! So win thou! In thy thoughts Do all thou dost for Me! Renounce for Me! Sacrifice heart and mind and will to Me!"
p298
aS' Live in the faith of Me! In faith of Me All dangers thou shalt vanquish, by My grace; But, trusting to thyself and heeding not, Thou can\'st but perish! If this day thou say\'st, Relying on thyself, "I will not fight!" Vain will the purpose prove! thy qualities Would spur thee to the war. What thou dost shun, Misled by fair illusions, thou wouldst seek Against thy will, when the task comes to thee Waking the promptings in thy nature set.'
p299
aS' There lives a Master in the hearts of men Maketh their deeds, by subtle pulling--strings, Dance to what tune HE will. With all thy soul Trust Him, and take Him for thy succour, Prince!'
p300
aS' So--only so, Arjuna!--shalt thou gain-- By grace of Him--the uttermost repose, The Eternal Place! Thus hath been opened thee This Truth of Truths, the Mystery more hid Than any secret mystery. Meditate! And--as thou wilt--then act!'
p301
aS' Nay! but once more Take My last word, My utmost meaning have! Precious thou art to Me; right well-beloved! Listen! I tell thee for thy comfort this. Give Me thy heart! adore Me! serve Me! cling In faith and love and reverence to Me! So shalt thou come to Me! I promise true, For thou art sweet to Me!'
p302
aS" And let go those-- Rites and writ duties! Fly to Me alone! Make Me thy single refuge! I will free Thy soul from all its sins! Be of good cheer! [Hide, the holy Krishna saith, This from him that hath no faith, Him that worships not, nor seeks Wisdom's teaching when she speaks:"
p303
aS" Hide it from all men who mock; But, wherever, 'mid the flock Of My lovers, one shall teach This divinest, wisest, speech-- Teaching in the faith to bring Truth to them, and offering Of all honour unto Me-- Unto Brahma cometh he! Nay, and nowhere shall ye find Any man of all mankind Doing dearer deed for Me;"
p304
aS" Nor shall any dearer be In My earth. Yea, furthermore, Whoso reads this converse o'er, Held by Us upon the plain, Pondering piously and fain, He hath paid Me sacrifice!"
p305
aS' (Krishna speaketh in this wise!) Yea, and whoso, full of faith, Heareth wisely what it saith, Heareth meekly,--when he dies, Surely shall his spirit rise To those regions where the Blest, Free of flesh, in joyance rest.]'
p306
aS' Hath this been heard by thee, O Indian Prince! With mind intent? hath all the ignorance-- Which bred thy trouble--vanished, My Arjun?'
p307
aS' Arjuna. Trouble and ignorance are gone! the Light Hath come unto me, by Thy favour, Lord! Now am I fixed! my doubt is fled away! According to Thy word, so will I do!'
p308
aS" Sanjaya. Thus gathered I the gracious speech of Krishna, O my King! Thus have I told, with heart a-thrill, this wise and wondrous thing By great Vyasa's learning writ, how Krishna's self made known The Yoga, being Yoga's Lord. So is the high truth shown! And aye, when I remember, O Lord my King, again Arjuna and the God in talk, and all this holy strain, Great is my gladness: when I muse that splendour, passing speech, Of Hari, visible and plain, there is no tongue to reach My marvel and my love and bliss. O Archer-Prince! all hail!"
p309
aS' O Krishna, Lord of Yoga! surely there shall not fail Blessing, and victory, and power, for Thy most mighty sake, Where this song comes of Arjun, and how with God he spake.'

aS' so have i told of life s stuff  and the moulding  and the lore to comprehend  whoso  adoring me  perceiveth this  shall surely come to me  know thou that nature and the spirit both have no beginning  know that qualities and changes of them are by nature wrought  that nature puts to work the acting frame  but spirit doth inform it  and so cause feeling of pain and pleasure  spirit  linked to moulded matter  entereth into bond with qualities by nature framed  and  thus married to matter  breeds the birth again in good or evil yonis '

p483
aS' for  whoso thus beholds  in every place  in every form  the same  one  living life  doth no more wrongfulness unto himself  but goes the highest road which brings to bliss  seeing  he sees  indeed  who sees that works are nature s wont  for soul to practise by acting  yet not the agent  sees the mass of separate living things  each of its kind   issue from one  and blend again to one  then hath he brahma  he attains '

aS' o prince  that ultimate  high spirit  uncreate  unqualified  even when it entereth flesh taketh no stain of acts  worketh in nought  like to the ethereal air  pervading all  which  for sheer subtlety  avoideth taint  the subtle soul sits everywhere  unstained  like to the light of the all piercing sun  which is not changed by aught it shines upon   the soul s light shineth pure in every place  and they who  by such eye of wisdom  see how matter  and what deals with it  divide  and how the spirit and the flesh have strife  those wise ones go the way which leads to life '
p485
aS' krishna  yet farther will i open unto thee this wisdom of all wisdoms  uttermost  the which possessing  all my saints have passed to perfectness  on such high verities reliant  rising into fellowship with me  they are not born again at birth of kalpas  nor at pralyas suffer change '
p486
aS' this universe the womb is where i plant seed of all lives  thence  prince of india  comes birth to all beings  whoso  kunti s son  mothers each mortal form  brahma conceives  and i am he that fathers  sending seed  sattwan  rajas  and tamas  so are named the qualities of nature   soothfastness    passion   and  ignorance   these three bind down the changeless spirit in the changeful flesh  '
p487
aS' whereof sweet  soothfastness   by purity living unsullied and enlightened  binds the sinless soul to happiness and truth  and passion  being kin to appetite  and breeding impulse and propensity  binds the embodied soul  o kunti s son  by tie of works  but ignorance  begot of darkness  blinding mortal men  binds down their souls to stupor  sloth  and drowsiness '
p488
aS' yea  prince of india  soothfastness binds souls in pleasant wise to flesh  and passion binds by toilsome strain  but ignorance  which blots the beams of wisdom  binds the soul to sloth  passion and ignorance  once overcome  leave soothfastness  o bharata  where this with ignorance are absent  passion rules  and ignorance in hearts not good nor quick '
p489
aS' when at all gateways of the body shines the lamp of knowledge  then may one see well soothfastness settled in that city reigns  where longing is  and ardour  and unrest  impulse to strive and gain  and avarice  those spring from passion  prince   engrained  and where darkness and dulness  sloth and stupor are   tis ignorance hath caused them  kuru chief '
p490
aS' moreover  when a soul departeth  fixed in soothfastness  it goeth to the place   perfect and pure  of those that know all truth  if it departeth in set habitude of impulse  it shall pass into the world of spirits tied to works  and  if it dies in hardened ignorance  that blinded soul is born anew in some unlighted womb '
p491
aS' the fruit of soothfastness is true and sweet  the fruit of lusts is pain and toil  the fruit of ignorance is deeper darkness  yea  for light brings light  and passion ache to have  and gloom  bewilderments  and ignorance grow forth from ignorance  those of the first rise ever higher  those of the second mode take a mid place  the darkened souls sink back to lower deeps  loaded with witlessness '
p492
aS' when  watching life  the living man perceives the only actors are the qualities  and knows what rules beyond the qualities  then is he come nigh unto me '
p493
aS' the soul  thus passing forth from the three qualities   whereby arise all bodies  overcomes birth  death  sorrow  and age  and drinketh deep the undying wine of amrit '

aS' he unto whom  self centred  grief and joy sound as one word  to whose deep seeing eyes the clod  the marble  and the gold are one  whose equal heart holds the same gentleness for lovely and unlovely things  firm set  well pleased in praise and dispraise  satisfied with honour or dishonour  unto friends and unto foes alike in tolerance  detached from undertakings   he is named surmounter of the qualities '
p497
aS' and such   with single  fervent faith adoring me  passing beyond the qualities  conforms to brahma  and attains me  for i am that whereof brahma is the likeness  mine the amrit is  and immortality is mine  and mine perfect felicity '

p499
aS' if ye knew well the teaching of the tree  what its shape saith  and whence it springs  and  then how it must end  and all the ills of it  the axe of sharp detachment ye would whet  and cleave the clinging snaky roots  and lay this aswattha of sense life low   to set new growths upspringing to that happier sky    which they who reach shall have no day to die  nor fade away  nor fall  to him  i mean  father and first  who made the mystery of old creation  for to him come they from passion and from dreams who break away '

p503
aS' the unenlightened ones mark not that spirit when he goes or comes  nor when he takes his pleasure in the form  conjoined with qualities  but those see plain who have the eyes to see  holy souls see which strive thereto  enlightened  they perceive that spirit in themselves  but foolish ones  even though they strive  discern not  having hearts unkindled  ill informed '

p519
aS' conforms itself to what he truly is  where thou shalt see a worshipper  that one to what he worships lives assimilate  such as the shrine  so is the votary   the  soothfast  souls adore true gods  the souls obeying rajas worship rakshasas or yakshas  and the men of darkness pray to pretas and to bhutas  yea  and those who practise bitter penance  not enjoined by rightful rule  penance which hath its root in self sufficient  proud hypocrisies   those men  passion beset  violent  wild  torturing  the witless ones  my elements shut in fair company within their flesh   nay  me myself  present within the flesh  '
p520
aS' know them to devils devoted  not to heaven  for like as foods are threefold for mankind in nourishing  so is there threefold way of worship  abstinence  and almsgiving '
p521
aS' hear this of me  there is a food which brings force  substance  strength  and health  and joy to live  being well seasoned  cordial  comforting  the  soothfast  meat  and there be foods which bring aches and unrests  and burning blood  and grief  being too biting  heating  salt  and sharp  and therefore craved by too strong appetite '

p523
aS' thus with rites    a sacrifice not for rewardment made  offered in rightful wise  when he who vows sayeth  with heart devout   this i should do   is  soothfast  rite  but sacrifice for gain  offered for good repute  be sure that this  o best of bharatas  is rajas rite  with stamp of  passion   and a sacrifice offered against the laws  with no due dole of food giving  with no accompaniment of hallowed hymn  nor largesse to the priests  in faithless celebration  call it vile  the deed of  darkness    lost '

aS' worship of gods meriting worship  lowly reverence of twice borns  teachers  elders  purity  rectitude  and the brahmacharya s vow  and not to injure any helpless thing    '

p526
aS' such threefold faith  in highest piety kept  with no hope of gain  by hearts devote  is perfect work of sattwan  true belief  religion shown in act of proud display to win good entertainment  worship  fame  such  say i  is of rajas  rash and vain '

p531
aS' there be among the saints some who have held all action sinful  and to be renounced  and some who answer   nay  the goodly acts   as worship  penance  alms  must be performed   hear now my sentence  best of bharatas   tis well set forth  o chaser of thy foes  renunciation is of threefold form  and worship  penance  alms  not to be stayed '
p532
aS' nay  to be gladly done  for all those three are purifying waters for true souls  yet must be practised even those high works in yielding up attachment  and all fruit produced by works  this is my judgment  prince  this my insuperable and fixed decree '
p533
aS' abstaining from a work by right prescribed never is meet  so to abstain doth spring from  darkness   and delusion teacheth it  abstaining from a work grievous to flesh  when one saith   tis unpleasing   this is null  such an one acts from  passion   nought of gain wins his renunciation  but  arjun '
p534
aS' abstaining from attachment to the work  abstaining from rewardment in the work  while yet one doeth it full faithfully  saying   tis right to do   that is  true   act and abstinence  who doeth duties so  unvexed if his work fail  if it succeed unflattered  in his own heart justified  quit of debates and doubts  his is  true  act '
p535
aS' for  being in the body  none may stand wholly aloof from act  yet  who abstains from profit of his acts is abstinent  the fruit of labours  in the lives to come  is threefold for all men   desirable  and undesirable  and mixed of both  but no fruit is at all where no work was  hear from me  long armed lord  the makings five which go to every act  in sankhya taught as necessary  first the force  and then the agent  next  the various instruments '

p537
aS' knowledge  the thing known  and the mind which knows  these make the threefold starting ground of act  the act  the actor  and the instrument  these make the threefold total of the deed '
p538
aS' but knowledge  agent  act  are differenced by three dividing qualities  hear now which be the qualities dividing them  there is  true  knowledge  learn thou it is this  to see one changeless life in all the lives  and in the separate  one inseparable '
p539
aS' there is imperfect knowledge  that which sees the separate existences apart  and  being separated  holds them real  there is false knowledge  that which blindly clings to one as if  twere all  seeking no cause  deprived of light  narrow  and dull  and  dark  '
p540
aS' there is  right  action  that which being enjoined   is wrought without attachment  passionlessly  for duty  not for love  nor hate  nor gain  there is  vain  action  that which men pursue aching to satisfy desires  impelled by sense of self  with all absorbing stress '
p541
aS' this is of rajas  passionate and vain  there is  dark  action  when one doth a thing heedless of issues  heedless of the hurt or wrong for others  heedless if he harm his own soul   tis of tamas  black and bad  there is the  rightful doer  he who acts free from self seeking  humble  resolute  steadfast  in good or evil hap the same  content to do aright he  truly  acts '
p542
aS' there is th   impassioned  doer  he that works from impulse  seeking profit  rude and bold to overcome  unchastened  slave by turns of sorrow and of joy  of rajas he  and there be evil doers  loose of heart  low minded  stubborn  fraudulent  remiss  dull  slow  despondent  children of the  dark  '
p543
aS' hear  too  of intellect and steadfastness the threefold separation  conqueror prince  how these are set apart by qualities  good is the intellect which comprehends the coming forth and going back of life  what must be done  and what must not be done  what should be feared  and what should not be feared  what binds and what emancipates the soul '
p544
aS' that is of sattwan  prince  of  soothfastness   marred is the intellect which  knowing right and knowing wrong  and what is well to do and what must not be done  yet understands nought with firm mind  nor as the calm truth is  this is of rajas  prince  and  passionate  '
p545
aS' evil is intellect which  wrapped in gloom  looks upon wrong as right  and sees all things contrariwise of truth  o pritha s son  that is of tamas   dark  and desperate  good is the steadfastness whereby a man masters his beats of heart  his very breath of life  the action of his senses  fixed in never shaken faith and piety '
p546

p548
aS' and foul and  dark  the pleasure is which springs from sloth and sin and foolishness  at first and at the last  and all the way of life the soul bewildering   tis of tamas  prince  for nothing lives on earth  nor  midst the gods in utmost heaven  but hath its being bound with these three qualities  by nature framed '

S' dhritirashtra  ranged thus for battle on the sacred plain   on kurukshetra  say  sanjaya  say what wrought my people  and the pandavas  sanjaya  when he beheld the host of pandavas  raja duryodhana to drona drew  and spake these words   ah  guru  see this line  how vast it is of pandu fighting men  embattled by the son of drupada  thy scholar in the war  therein stand ranked chiefs like arjuna  like to bhima chiefs  benders of bows  virata  yuyudhan  drupada  eminent upon his car  dhrishtaket  chekitan  kasi s stout lord  purujit  kuntibhoj  and saivya  with yudhamanyu  and uttamauj subhadra s child  and drupadi s  all famed  all mounted on their shining chariots  on our side  too   thou best of brahmans  see excellent chiefs  commanders of my line  whose names i joy to count  thyself the first  then bhishma  karna  kripa fierce in fight  vikarna  aswatthaman  next to these strong saumadatti  with full many more valiant and tried  ready this day to die for me their king  each with his weapon grasped  each skilful in the field  weakest meseems  our battle shows where bhishma holds command  and bhima  fronting him  something too strong  have care our captains nigh to bhishma s ranks prepare what help they may  now  blow my shell   then  at the signal of the aged king  with blare to wake the blood  rolling around like to a lion s roar  the trumpeter blew the great conch  and  at the noise of it  trumpets and drums  cymbals and gongs and horns burst into sudden clamour  as the blasts of loosened tempest  such the tumult seemed  then might be seen  upon their car of gold yoked with white steeds  blowing their battle shells  krishna the god  arjuna at his side  krishna  with knotted locks  blew his great conch carved of the  giant s bone   arjuna blew indra s loud gift  bhima the terrible   wolf bellied bhima blew a long reed conch  and yudhisthira  kunti s blameless son  winded a mighty shell   victory s voice   and nakula blew shrill upon his conch named the  sweet sounding   sahadev on his called  gem bedecked   and kasi s prince on his  sikhandi on his car  dhrishtadyumn  virata  satyaki the unsubdued  drupada  with his sons   o lord of earth   long armed subhadra s children  all blew loud  so that the clangour shook their foemen s hearts  with quaking earth and thundering heav n  then  twas  beholding dhritirashtra s battle set  weapons unsheathing  bows drawn forth  the war instant to break arjun  whose ensign badge was hanuman the monkey  spake this thing to krishna the divine  his charioteer   drive  dauntless one  to yonder open ground betwixt the armies  i would see more nigh these who will fight with us  those we must slay to day  in war s arbitrament  for  sure  on bloodshed all are bent who throng this plain  obeying dhritirashtra s sinful son   thus  by arjuna prayed   o bharata   between the hosts that heavenly charioteer drove the bright car  reining its milk white steeds where bhishma led and drona and their lords   see   spake he to arjuna   where they stand  thy kindred of the kurus   and the prince marked on each hand the kinsmen of his house  grandsires and sires  uncles and brothers and sons  cousins and sons in law and nephews  mixed with friends and honoured elders  some this side  some that side ranged  and  seeing those opposed  such kith grown enemies arjuna s heart melted with pity  while he uttered this  arjuna  krishna  as i behold  come here to shed their common blood  yon concourse of our kin  my members fail  my tongue dries in my mouth  a shudder thrills my body  and my hair bristles with horror  from my weak hand slips gandiv  the goodly bow  a fever burns my skin to parching  hardly may i stand  the life within me seems to swim and faint  nothing do i foresee save woe and wail  it is not good  o keshav  nought of good can spring from mutual slaughter  lo  i hate triumph and domination  wealth and ease  thus sadly won  aho  what victory can bring delight  govinda  what rich spoils could profit  what rule recompense  what span of life itself seem sweet  bought with such blood  seeing that these stand here  ready to die  for whose sake life was fair  and pleasure pleased  and power grew precious  grandsires  sires  and sons  brothers  and fathers in law  and sons in law  elders and friends  shall i deal death on these even though they seek to slay us  not one blow  o madhusudan  will i strike to gain the rule of all three worlds  then  how much less to seize an earthly kingdom  killing these must breed but anguish  krishna  if they be guilty  we shall grow guilty by their deaths  their sins will light on us  if we shall slay those sons of dhritirashtra  and our kin  what peace could come of that  o madhava  for if indeed  blinded by lust and wrath  these cannot see  or will not see  the sin of kingly lines o erthrown and kinsmen slain  how should not we  who see  shun such a crime   we who perceive the guilt and feel the shame   o thou delight of men  janardana  by overthrow of houses perisheth their sweet continuous household piety  and rites neglected  piety extinct   enters impiety upon that home  its women grow unwomaned  whence there spring mad passions  and the mingling up of castes  sending a hell ward road that family  and whoso wrought its doom by wicked wrath  nay  and the souls of honoured ancestors fall from their place of peace  being bereft of funeral cakes and the wan death water  so teach our holy hymns  thus  if we slay kinsfolk and friends for love of earthly power  ahovat  what an evil fault it were  better i deem it  if my kinsmen strike  to face them weaponless  and bare my breast to shaft and spear  than answer blow with blow  so speaking  in the face of those two hosts  arjuna sank upon his chariot seat  and let fall bow and arrows  sick at heart  sanjaya  him  filled with such compassion and such grief  with eyes tear dimmed  despondent  in stern words the driver  madhusudan  thus addressed  krishna  how hath this weakness taken thee  whence springs the inglorious trouble  shameful to the brave  barring the path of virtue  nay  arjun  forbid thyself to feebleness  it mars thy warrior name  cast off the coward fit  wake  be thyself  arise  scourge of thy foes  arjuna  how can i  in the battle  shoot with shafts on bhishma  or on drona o thou chief    both worshipful  both honourable men  better to live on beggar s bread with those we love alive  than taste their blood in rich feasts spread  and guiltily survive  ah  were it worse who knows   to be victor or vanquished here  when those confront us angrily whose death leaves living drear  in pity lost  by doubtings tossed  my thoughts distracted turn to thee  the guide i reverence most  that i may counsel learn  i know not what would heal the grief burned into soul and sense  if i were earth s unchallenged chief   a god  and these gone thence  sanjaya  so spake arjuna to the lord of hearts  and sighing  i will not fight   held silence then  to whom  with tender smile   o bharata    while the prince wept despairing  twixt those hosts  krishna made answer in divinest verse  krishna  thou grievest where no grief should be  thou speak st words lacking wisdom  for the wise in heart mourn not for those that live  nor those that die  nor i  nor thou  nor any one of these  ever was not  nor ever will not be  for ever and for ever afterwards  all  that doth live  lives always  to man s frame as there come infancy and youth and age  so come there raisings up and layings down of other and of other life abodes  which the wise know  and fear not  this that irks   thy sense life  thrilling to the elements   bringing thee heat and cold  sorrows and joys   tis brief and mutable  bear with it  prince  as the wise bear  the soul which is not moved  the soul that with a strong and constant calm takes sorrow and takes joy indifferently  lives in the life undying  that which is can never cease to be  that which is not will not exist  to see this truth of both is theirs who part essence from accident  substance from shadow  indestructible  learn thou  the life is  spreading life through all  it cannot anywhere  by any means  be anywise diminished  stayed  or changed  but for these fleeting frames which it informs with spirit deathless  endless  infinite  they perish  let them perish  prince  and fight  he who shall say   lo  i have slain a man   he who shall think   lo  i am slain   those both know naught  life cannot slay  life is not slain  never the spirit was born  the spirit shall cease to be never  never was time it was not  end and beginning are dreams  birthless and deathless and changeless remaineth the spirit for ever  death hath not touched it at all  dead though the house of it seems  who knoweth it exhaustless  self sustained  immortal  indestructible   shall such say   i have killed a man  or caused to kill   nay  but as when one layeth his worn out robes away  and taking new ones  sayeth   these will i wear to day   so putteth by the spirit lightly its garb of flesh  and passeth to inherit a residence afresh  i say to thee weapons reach not the life  flame burns it not  waters cannot o erwhelm  nor dry winds wither it  impenetrable  unentered  unassailed  unharmed  untouched  immortal  all arriving  stable  sure  invisible  ineffable  by word and thought uncompassed  ever all itself  thus is the soul declared  how wilt thou  then    knowing it so   grieve when thou shouldst not grieve  how  if thou hearest that the man new dead is  like the man new born  still living man   one same  existent spirit  wilt thou weep  the end of birth is death  the end of death is birth  this is ordained  and mournest thou  chief of the stalwart arm  for what befalls which could not otherwise befall  the birth of living things comes unperceived  the death comes unperceived  between them  beings perceive  what is there sorrowful herein  dear prince  wonderful  wistful  to contemplate  difficult  doubtful  to speak upon  strange and great for tongue to relate  mystical hearing for every one  nor wotteth man this  what a marvel it is  when seeing  and saying  and hearing are done  this life within all living things  my prince  hides beyond harm  scorn thou to suffer  then  for that which cannot suffer  do thy part  be mindful of thy name  and tremble not  nought better can betide a martial soul than lawful war  happy the warrior to whom comes joy of battle  comes  as now  glorious and fair  unsought  opening for him a gateway unto heav n  but  if thou shunn st this honourable field  a kshattriya   if  knowing thy duty and thy task  thou bidd st duty and task go by  that shall be sin  and those to come shall speak thee infamy from age to age  but infamy is worse for men of noble blood to bear than death  the chiefs upon their battle chariots will deem  twas fear that drove thee from the fray  of those who held thee mighty souled the scorn thou must abide  while all thine enemies will scatter bitter speech of thee  to mock the valour which thou hadst  what fate could fall more grievously than this  either  being killed   thou wilt win swarga s safety  or  alive and victor  thou wilt reign an earthly king  therefore  arise  thou son of kunti  brace thine arm for conflict  nerve thy heart to meet   as things alike to thee  pleasure or pain  profit or ruin  victory or defeat  so minded  gird thee to the fight  for so thou shalt not sin  thus far i speak to thee as from the  sankhya   unspiritually   hear now the deeper teaching of the yog  which holding  understanding  thou shalt burst thy karmabandh  the bondage of wrought deeds  here shall no end be hindered  no hope marred  no loss be feared  faith  yea  a little faith   shall save thee from the anguish of thy dread  here  glory of the kurus  shines one rule   one steadfast rule  while shifting souls have laws many and hard   specious  but wrongful deem the speech of those ill taught ones who extol the letter of their vedas  saying   this is all we have  or need   being weak at heart with wants  seekers of heaven  which comes  they say   as  fruit of good deeds done   promising men much profit in new births for works of faith  in various rites abounding  following whereon large merit shall accrue towards wealth and power  albeit  who wealth and power do most desire least fixity of soul have such  least hold on heavenly meditation  much these teach  from veds  concerning the  three qualities   but thou  be free of the  three qualities   free of the  pairs of opposites   and free from that sad righteousness which calculates  self ruled  arjuna  simple  satisfied  look  like as when a tank pours water forth to suit all needs  so do these brahmans draw text for all wants from tank of holy writ  but thou  want not  ask not  find full reward of doing right in right  let right deeds be thy motive  not the fruit which comes from them  and live in action  labour  make thine acts thy piety  casting all self aside  contemning gain and merit  equable in good or evil  equability is yog  is piety  yet  the right act is less  far less  than the right thinking mind  seek refuge in thy soul  have there thy heaven  scorn them that follow virtue for her gifts  the mind of pure devotion  even here   casts equally aside good deeds and bad  passing above them  unto pure devotion devote thyself  with perfect meditation comes perfect act  and the right hearted rise   more certainly because they seek no gain   forth from the bands of body  step by step  to highest seats of bliss  when thy firm soul hath shaken off those tangled oracles which ignorantly guide  then shall it soar to high neglect of what s denied or said  this way or that way  in doctrinal writ  troubled no longer by the priestly lore  safe shall it live  and sure  steadfastly bent on meditation  this is yog  and peace  arjuna  what is his mark who hath that steadfast heart  confirmed in holy meditation  how know we his speech  kesava  sits he  moves he like other men  krishna  when one  o pritha s son  abandoning desires which shake the mind   finds in his soul full comfort for his soul  he hath attained the yog  that man is such  in sorrows not dejected  and in joys not overjoyed  dwelling outside the stress of passion  fear  and anger  fixed in calms of lofty contemplation   such an one is muni  is the sage  the true recluse  he who to none and nowhere overbound by ties of flesh  takes evil things and good neither desponding nor exulting  such bears wisdom s plainest mark  he who shall draw as the wise tortoise draws its four feet safe under its shield  his five frail senses back under the spirit s buckler from the world which else assails them  such an one  my prince  hath wisdom s mark  things that solicit sense hold off from the self governed  nay  it comes  the appetites of him who lives beyond depart   aroused no more  yet may it chance  o son of kunti  that a governed mind shall some time feel the sense storms sweep  and wrest strong self control by the roots  let him regain his kingdom  let him conquer this  and sit on me intent  that man alone is wise who keeps the mastery of himself  if one ponders on objects of the sense  there springs attraction  from attraction grows desire  desire flames to fierce passion  passion breeds recklessness  then the memory  all betrayed   lets noble purpose go  and saps the mind  till purpose  mind  and man are all undone   but  if one deals with objects of the sense not loving and not hating  making them serve his free soul  which rests serenely lord  lo  such a man comes to tranquillity  and out of that tranquillity shall rise the end and healing of his earthly pains  since the will governed sets the soul at peace  the soul of the ungoverned is not his  nor hath he knowledge of himself  which lacked  how grows serenity  and  wanting that  whence shall he hope for happiness  the mind that gives itself to follow shows of sense seeth its helm of wisdom rent away  and  like a ship in waves of whirlwind  drives to wreck and death  only with him  great prince  whose senses are not swayed by things of sense   only with him who holds his mastery  shows wisdom perfect  what is midnight gloom to unenlightened souls shines wakeful day to his clear gaze  what seems as wakeful day is known for night  thick night of ignorance  to his true seeing eyes  such is the saint  and like the ocean  day by day receiving floods from all lands  which never overflows its boundary line not leaping  and not leaving  fed by the rivers  but unswelled by those    so is the perfect one  to his soul s ocean the world of sense pours streams of witchery  they leave him as they find  without commotion  taking their tribute  but remaining sea  yea  whoso  shaking off the yoke of flesh lives lord  not servant  of his lusts  set free from pride  from passion  from the sin of  self   toucheth tranquillity  o pritha s son  that is the state of brahm  there rests no dread when that last step is reached  live where he will  die when he may  such passeth from all  plaining  to blest nirvana  with the gods  attaining  arjuna  thou whom all mortals praise  janardana  if meditation be a nobler thing than action  wherefore  then  great kesava  dost thou impel me to this dreadful fight  now am i by thy doubtful speech disturbed  tell me one thing  and tell me certainly  by what road shall i find the better end  krishna  i told thee  blameless lord  there be two paths shown to this world  two schools of wisdom  first the sankhya s  which doth save in way of works prescribed by reason  next  the yog  which bids attain by meditation  spiritually  yet these are one  no man shall  scape from act by shunning action  nay  and none shall come by mere renouncements unto perfectness  nay  and no jot of time  at any time  rests any actionless  his nature s law compels him  even unwilling  into act  for thought is act in fancy  he who sits suppressing all the instruments of flesh  yet in his idle heart thinking on them  plays the inept and guilty hypocrite  but he who  with strong body serving mind  gives up his mortal powers to worthy work  not seeking gain  arjuna  such an one is honourable  do thine allotted task  work is more excellent than idleness  the body s life proceeds not  lacking work  there is a task of holiness to do  unlike world binding toil  which bindeth not the faithful soul  such earthly duty do free from desire  and thou shalt well perform thy heavenly purpose  spake prajapati   in the beginning  when all men were made  and  with mankind  the sacrifice    do this   work  sacrifice  increase and multiply with sacrifice  this shall be kamaduk  your  cow of plenty   giving back her milk of all abundance  worship the gods thereby  the gods shall yield thee grace  those meats ye crave the gods will grant to labour  when it pays tithes in the altar flame  but if one eats fruits of the earth  rendering to kindly heaven no gift of toil  that thief steals from his world   who eat of food after their sacrifice are quit of fault  but they that spread a feast all for themselves  eat sin and drink of sin  by food the living live  food comes of rain  and rain comes by the pious sacrifice  and sacrifice is paid with tithes of toil  thus action is of brahma  who is one  the only  all pervading  at all times present in sacrifice  he that abstains to help the rolling wheels of this great world  glutting his idle sense  lives a lost life  shameful and vain  existing for himself  self concentrated  serving self alone  no part hath he in aught  nothing achieved  nought wrought or unwrought toucheth him  no hope of help for all the living things of earth depends from him  therefore  thy task prescribed with spirit unattached gladly perform  since in performance of plain duty man mounts to his highest bliss  by works alone janak and ancient saints reached blessedness  moreover  for the upholding of thy kind  action thou should st embrace  what the wise choose the unwise people take  what best men do the multitude will follow  look on me  thou son of pritha  in the three wide worlds i am not bound to any toil  no height awaits to scale  no gift remains to gain  yet i act here  and  if i acted not   earnest and watchful  those that look to me for guidance  sinking back to sloth again because i slumbered  would decline from good  and i should break earth s order and commit her offspring unto ruin  bharata  even as the unknowing toil  wedded to sense  so let the enlightened toil  sense freed  but set to bring the world deliverance  and its bliss  not sowing in those simple  busy hearts seed of despair  yea  let each play his part in all he finds to do  with unyoked soul  all things are everywhere by nature wrought in interaction of the qualities  the fool  cheated by self  thinks   this i did  and  that i wrought   but  ah  thou strong armed prince    a better lessoned mind  knowing the play of visible things within the world of sense  and how the qualities must qualify  standeth aloof even from his acts  th  untaught live mixed with them  knowing not nature s way  of highest aims unwitting  slow and dull  those make thou not to stumble  having the light  but all thy dues discharging  for my sake  with meditation centred inwardly  seeking no profit  satisfied  serene  heedless of issue  fight  they who shall keep my ordinance thus  the wise and willing hearts  have quittance from all issue of their acts  but those who disregard my ordinance  thinking they know  know nought  and fall to loss  confused and foolish   sooth  the instructed one doth of his kind  following what fits him most  and lower creatures of their kind  in vain contending  gainst the law  needs must it be the objects of the sense will stir the sense to like and dislike  yet th  enlightened man yields not to these  knowing them enemies  finally  this is better  that one do his own task as he may  even though he fail  than take tasks not his own  though they seem good  to die performing duty is no ill  but who seeks other roads shall wander still  arjuna  yet tell me  teacher  by what force doth man go to his ill  unwilling  as if one pushed him that evil path  krishna  kama it is  passion it is  born of the darknesses  which pusheth him  mighty of appetite  sinful  and strong is this   man s enemy  as smoke blots the white fire  as clinging rust mars the bright mirror  as the womb surrounds the babe unborn  so is the world of things foiled  soiled  enclosed in this desire of flesh  the wise fall  caught in it  the unresting foe it is of wisdom  wearing countless forms  fair but deceitful  subtle as a flame  sense  mind  and reason  these  o kunti s son  are booty for it  in its play with these it maddens man  beguiling  blinding him  therefore  thou noblest child of bharata  govern thy heart  constrain th  entangled sense  resist the false  soft sinfulness which saps knowledge and judgment  yea  the world is strong  but what discerns it stronger  and the mind strongest  and high o er all the ruling soul  wherefore  perceiving him who reigns supreme  put forth full force of soul in thy own soul  fight  vanquish foes and doubts  dear hero  slay what haunts thee in fond shapes  and would betray  krishna  this deathless yoga  this deep union  i taught vivaswata  the lord of light  vivaswata to manu gave it  he to ikshwaku  so passed it down the line of all my royal rishis  then  with years  the truth grew dim and perished  noble prince  now once again to thee it is declared   this ancient lore  this mystery supreme   seeing i find thee votary and friend  arjuna  thy birth  dear lord  was in these later days  and bright vivaswata s preceded time  how shall i comprehend this thing thou sayest   from the beginning it was i who taught   krishna  manifold the renewals of my birth have been  arjuna  and of thy births  too  but mine i know  and thine thou knowest not  o slayer of thy foes  albeit i be unborn  undying  indestructible  the lord of all things living  not the less   by maya  by my magic which i stamp on floating nature forms  the primal vast   i come  and go  and come  when righteousness declines  o bharata  when wickedness is strong  i rise  from age to age  and take visible shape  and move a man with men  succouring the good  thrusting the evil back  and setting virtue on her seat again  who knows the truth touching my births on earth and my divine work  when he quits the flesh puts on its load no more  falls no more down to earthly birth  to me he comes  dear prince  many there be who come  from fear set free  from anger  from desire  keeping their hearts fixed upon me  my faithful  purified by sacred flame of knowledge  such as these mix with my being  whoso worship me  them i exalt  but all men everywhere shall fall into my path  albeit  those souls which seek reward for works  make sacrifice now  to the lower gods  i say to thee here have they their reward  but i am he made the four castes  and portioned them a place after their qualities and gifts  yea  i created  the reposeful  i that live immortally  made all those mortal births  for works soil not my essence  being works wrought uninvolved  who knows me acting thus unchained by action  action binds not him  and  so perceiving  all those saints of old worked  seeking for deliverance  work thou as  in the days gone by  thy fathers did  thou sayst  perplexed  it hath been asked before by singers and by sages   what is act  and what inaction   i will teach thee this  and  knowing  thou shalt learn which work doth save needs must one rightly meditate those three   doing   not doing   and undoing  here thorny and dark the path is  he who sees how action may be rest  rest action  he is wisest  mid his kind  he hath the truth  he doeth well  acting or resting  freed in all his works from prickings of desire  burned clean in act by the white fire of truth  the wise call that man wise  and such an one  renouncing fruit of deeds  always content  always self satisfying  if he works  doth nothing that shall stain his separate soul  which  quit of fear and hope  subduing self   rejecting outward impulse  yielding up to body s need nothing save body  dwells sinless amid all sin  with equal calm taking what may befall  by grief unmoved  unmoved by joy  unenvyingly  the same in good and evil fortunes  nowise bound by bond of deeds  nay  but of such an one  whose crave is gone  whose soul is liberate  whose heart is set on truth  of such an one what work he does is work of sacrifice  which passeth purely into ash and smoke consumed upon the altar  all s then god  the sacrifice is brahm  the ghee and grain are brahm  the fire is brahm  the flesh it eats is brahm  and unto brahm attaineth he who  in such office  meditates on brahm   some votaries there be who serve the gods with flesh and altar smoke  but other some who  lighting subtler fires  make purer rite with will of worship  of the which be they who  in white flame of continence  consume joys of the sense  delights of eye and ear  forgoing tender speech and sound of song  and they who  kindling fires with torch of truth  burn on a hidden altar stone the bliss of youth and love  renouncing happiness  and they who lay for offering there their wealth  their penance  meditation  piety  their steadfast reading of the scrolls  their lore painfully gained with long austerities  and they who  making silent sacrifice  draw in their breath to feed the flame of thought  and breathe it forth to waft the heart on high  governing the ventage of each entering air lest one sigh pass which helpeth not the soul  and they who  day by day denying needs  lay life itself upon the altar flame  burning the body wan  lo  all these keep the rite of offering  as if they slew victims  and all thereby efface much sin  yea  and who feed on the immortal food left of such sacrifice  to brahma pass  to the unending  but for him that makes no sacrifice  he hath nor part nor lot even in the present world  how should he share another  o thou glory of thy line   in sight of brahma all these offerings are spread and are accepted  comprehend that all proceed by act  for knowing this  thou shalt be quit of doubt  the sacrifice which knowledge pays is better than great gifts offered by wealth  since gifts  worth  o my prince  lies in the mind which gives  the will that serves  and these are gained by reverence  by strong search  by humble heed of those who see the truth and teach it  knowing truth  thy heart no more will ache with error  for the truth shall show all things subdued to thee  as thou to me  moreover  son of pandu  wert thou worst of all wrong doers  this fair ship of truth should bear thee safe and dry across the sea of thy transgressions  as the kindled flame feeds on the fuel till it sinks to ash  so unto ash  arjuna  unto nought the flame of knowledge wastes works  dross away  there is no purifier like thereto in all this world  and he who seeketh it shall find it  being grown perfect  in himself  believing  he receives it when the soul masters itself  and cleaves to truth  and comes   possessing knowledge  to the higher peace  the uttermost repose  but those untaught  and those without full faith  and those who fear are shent  no peace is here or other where  no hope  nor happiness for whoso doubts  he that  being self contained  hath vanquished doubt  disparting self from service  soul from works  enlightened and emancipate  my prince  works fetter him no more  cut then atwain with sword of wisdom  son of bharata  this doubt that binds thy heart beats  cleave the bond born of thy ignorance  be bold and wise  give thyself to the field with me  arise  arjuna  yet  krishna  at the one time thou dost laud surcease of works  and  at another time  service through work  of these twain plainly tell which is the better way  krishna  to cease from works is well  and to do works in holiness is well  and both conduct to bliss supreme  but of these twain the better way is his who working piously refraineth not  that is the true renouncer  firm and fixed  who  seeking nought  rejecting nought  dwells proof against the  opposites   o valiant prince  in doing  such breaks lightly from all deed   tis the new scholar talks as they were two  this sankhya and this yoga  wise men know who husbands one plucks golden fruit of both  the region of high rest which sankhyans reach yogins attain  who sees these twain as one sees with clear eyes  yet such abstraction  chief  is hard to win without much holiness  whoso is fixed in holiness  self ruled  pure hearted  lord of senses and of self  lost in the common life of all which lives   a  yogayukt   he is a saint who wends straightway to brahm  such an one is not touched by taint of deeds   nought of myself i do   thus will he think who holds the truth of truths   in seeing  hearing  touching  smelling  when he eats  or goes  or breathes  slumbers or talks  holds fast or loosens  opes his eyes or shuts  always assured  this is the sense world plays with senses  he that acts in thought of brahm  detaching end from act  with act content  the world of sense can no more stain his soul than waters mar th  enamelled lotus leaf  with life  with heart  with mind  nay  with the help of all five senses  letting selfhood go   yogins toil ever towards their souls  release  such votaries  renouncing fruit of deeds  gain endless peace  the unvowed  the passion bound  seeking a fruit from works  are fastened down  the embodied sage  withdrawn within his soul  at every act sits godlike in  the town which hath nine gateways   neither doing aught nor causing any deed  this world s lord makes neither the work  nor passion for the work  nor lust for fruit of work  the man s own self pushes to these  the master of this world takes on himself the good or evil deeds of no man  dwelling beyond  mankind errs here by folly  darkening knowledge  but  for whom that darkness of the soul is chased by light  splendid and clear shines manifest the truth as if a sun of wisdom sprang to shed its beams of dawn  him meditating still  him seeking  with him blended  stayed on him  the souls illuminated take that road which hath no turning back  their sins flung off by strength of faith   who will may have this light  who hath it sees   to him who wisely sees  the brahman with his scrolls and sanctities  the cow  the elephant  the unclean dog  the outcast gorging dog s meat  are all one  the world is overcome  aye  even here  by such as fix their faith on unity  the sinless brahma dwells in unity  and they in brahma  be not over glad attaining joy  and be not over sad encountering grief  but  stayed on brahma  still constant let each abide  the sage whose soul holds off from outer contacts  in himself finds bliss  to brahma joined by piety  his spirit tastes eternal peace  the joys springing from sense life are but quickening wombs which breed sure griefs  those joys begin and end  the wise mind takes no pleasure  kunti s son  in such as those  but if a man shall learn  even while he lives and bears his body s chain  to master lust and anger  he is blest  he is the yukta  he hath happiness  contentment  light  within  his life is merged in brahma s life  he doth nirvana touch  thus go the rishis unto rest  who dwell with sins effaced  with doubts at end  with hearts governed and calm  glad in all good they live  nigh to the peace of god  and all those live who pass their days exempt from greed and wrath  subduing self and senses  knowing the soul  the saint who shuts outside his placid soul all touch of sense  letting no contact through  whose quiet eyes gaze straight from fixed brows  whose outward breath and inward breath are drawn equal and slow through nostrils still and close  that one with organs  heart  and mind constrained  bent on deliverance  having put away passion  and fear  and rage   hath  even now  obtained deliverance  ever and ever freed   yea  for he knows me who am he that heeds the sacrifice and worship  god revealed  and he who heeds not  being lord of worlds  lover of all that lives  god unrevealed  wherein who will shall find surety and shield  krishna  therefore  who doeth work rightful to do  not seeking gain from work  that man  o prince  is sanyasi and yogi  both in one and he is neither who lights not the flame of sacrifice  nor setteth hand to task  regard as true renouncer him that makes worship by work  for who renounceth not works not as yogin  so is that well said   by works the votary doth rise to faith  and saintship is the ceasing from all works  because the perfect yogin acts  but acts unmoved by passions and unbound by deeds  setting result aside  let each man raise the self by soul  not trample down his self  since soul that is self s friend may grow self s foe  soul is self s friend when self doth rule o er self  but self turns enemy if soul s own self hates self as not itself  the sovereign soul of him who lives self governed and at peace is centred in itself  taking alike pleasure and pain  heat  cold  glory and shame  he is the yogi  he is yukta  glad with joy of light and truth  dwelling apart upon a peak  with senses subjugate whereto the clod  the rock  the glistering gold show all as one  by this sign is he known being of equal grace to comrades  friends  chance comers  strangers  lovers  enemies  aliens and kinsmen  loving all alike  evil or good  sequestered should he sit  steadfastly meditating  solitary  his thoughts controlled  his passions laid away  quit of belongings  in a fair  still spot having his fixed abode   not too much raised  nor yet too low   let him abide  his goods a cloth  a deerskin  and the kusa grass  there  setting hard his mind upon the one  restraining heart and senses  silent  calm  let him accomplish yoga  and achieve pureness of soul  holding immovable body and neck and head  his gaze absorbed upon his nose end  rapt from all around  tranquil in spirit  free of fear  intent upon his brahmacharya vow  devout  musing on me  lost in the thought of me  that yojin  so devoted  so controlled  comes to the peace beyond   my peace  the peace of high nirvana  but for earthly needs religion is not his who too much fasts or too much feasts  nor his who sleeps away an idle mind  nor his who wears to waste his strength in vigils  nay  arjuna  call that the true piety which most removes earth aches and ills  where one is moderate in eating and in resting  and in sport  measured in wish and act  sleeping betimes  waking betimes for duty  when the man  so living  centres on his soul the thought straitly restrained  untouched internally by stress of sense  then is he yukta  see  steadfast a lamp burns sheltered from the wind  such is the likeness of the yogi s mind shut from sense storms and burning bright to heaven  when mind broods placid  soothed with holy wont  when self contemplates self  and in itself hath comfort  when it knows the nameless joy beyond all scope of sense  revealed to soul   only to soul  and  knowing  wavers not  true to the farther truth  when  holding this  it deems no other treasure comparable  but  harboured there  cannot be stirred or shook by any gravest grief  call that state  peace   that happy severance yoga  call that man the perfect yogin  steadfastly the will must toil thereto  till efforts end in ease  and thought has passed from thinking  shaking off all longings bred by dreams of fame and gain  shutting the doorways of the senses close with watchful ward  so  step by step  it comes to gift of peace assured and heart assuaged  when the mind dwells self wrapped  and the soul broods cumberless  but  as often as the heart breaks  wild and wavering  from control  so oft let him re curb it  let him rein it back to the soul s governance  for perfect bliss grows only in the bosom tranquillised  the spirit passionless  purged from offence  vowed to the infinite  he who thus vows his soul to the supreme soul  quitting sin  passes unhindered to the endless bliss of unity with brahma  he so vowed  so blended  sees the life soul resident in all things living  and all living things in that life soul contained  and whoso thus discerneth me in all  and all in me  i never let him go  nor looseneth he hold upon me  but  dwell he where he may  whate er his life  in me he dwells and lives  because he knows and worships me  who dwell in all which lives  and cleaves to me in all  arjuna  if a man sees everywhere   taught by his own similitude  one life  one essence in the evil and the good  hold him a yogi  yea  well perfected  arjuna  slayer of madhu  yet again  this yog  this peace  derived from equanimity  made known by thee  i see no fixity therein  no rest  because the heart of men is unfixed  krishna  rash  tumultuous  wilful and strong  it were all one  i think  to hold the wayward wind  as tame man s heart  krishna  hero long armed  beyond denial  hard man s heart is to restrain  and wavering  yet may it grow restrained by habit  prince  by wont of self command  this yog  i say  cometh not lightly to th  ungoverned ones  but he who will be master of himself shall win it  if he stoutly strive thereto  arjuna  and what road goeth he who  having faith  fails  krishna  in the striving  falling back from holiness  missing the perfect rule  is he not lost  straying from brahma s light  like the vain cloud  which floats  twixt earth and heaven when lightning splits it  and it vanisheth  fain would i hear thee answer me herein  since  krishna  none save thou can clear the doubt  krishna  he is not lost  thou son of pritha  no  nor earth  nor heaven is forfeit  even for him  because no heart that holds one right desire treadeth the road of loss  he who should fail  desiring righteousness  cometh at death unto the region of the just  dwells there measureless years  and being born anew  beginneth life again in some fair home amid the mild and happy  it may chance he doth descend into a yogin house on virtue s breast  but that is rare  such birth is hard to be obtained on this earth  chief  so hath he back again what heights of heart he did achieve  and so he strives anew to perfectness  with better hope  dear prince  for by the old desire he is drawn on unwittingly  and only to desire the purity of yog is to pass beyond the sabdabrahm  the spoken ved  but  being yogi  striving strong and long  purged from transgressions  perfected by births following on births  he plants his feet at last upon the farther path  such as one ranks above ascetics  higher than the wise  beyond achievers of vast deeds  be thou yogi arjuna  and of such believe  truest and best is he who worships me with inmost soul  stayed on my mystery  krishna  learn now  dear prince  how  if thy soul be set ever on me  still exercising yog  still making me thy refuge  thou shalt come most surely unto perfect hold of me  i will declare to thee that utmost lore  whole and particular  which  when thou knowest  leaveth no more to know here in this world  of many thousand mortals  one  perchance  striveth for truth  and of those few that strive   nay  and rise high  one only  here and there   knoweth me  as i am  the very truth  earth  water  flame  air  ether  life  and mind  and individuality  those eight make up the showing of me  manifest  these be my lower nature  learn the higher  whereby  thou valiant one  this universe is  by its principle of life  produced  whereby the worlds of visible things are born as from a yoni  know  i am that womb  i make and i unmake this universe  than me there is no other master  prince  no other maker  all these hang on me as hangs a row of pearls upon its string  i am the fresh taste of the water  i the silver of the moon  the gold o  the sun  the word of worship in the veds  the thrill that passeth in the ether  and the strength of man s shed seed  i am the good sweet smell of the moistened earth  i am the fire s red light  the vital air moving in all which moves  the holiness of hallowed souls  the root undying  whence hath sprung whatever is  the wisdom of the wise  the intellect of the informed  the greatness of the great  the splendour of the splendid  kunti s son  these am i  free from passion and desire  yet am i right desire in all who yearn  chief of the bharatas  for all those moods  soothfast  or passionate  or ignorant  which nature frames  deduce from me  but all are merged in me  not i in them  the world   deceived by those three qualities of being   wotteth not me who am outside them all  above them all  eternal  hard it is to pierce that veil divine of various shows which hideth me  yet they who worship me pierce it and pass beyond  i am not known to evil doers  nor to foolish ones  nor to the base and churlish  nor to those whose mind is cheated by the show of things  nor those that take the way of asuras  four sorts of mortals know me  he who weeps  arjuna  and the man who yearns to know  and he who toils to help  and he who sits certain of me  enlightened  of these four  o prince of india  highest  nearest  best that last is  the devout soul  wise  intent upon  the one   dear  above all  am i to him  and he is dearest unto me  all four are good  and seek me  but mine own  the true of heart  the faithful  stayed on me  taking me as their utmost blessedness  they are not  mine  but i  even i myself  at end of many births to me they come  yet hard the wise mahatma is to find  that man who sayeth   all is vasudev   there be those  too  whose knowledge  turned aside by this desire or that  gives them to serve some lower gods  with various rites  constrained by that which mouldeth them  unto all such   worship what shrine they will  what shapes  in faith    tis i who give them faith  i am content  the heart thus asking favour from its god  darkened but ardent  hath the end it craves  the lesser blessing  but  tis i who give  yet soon is withered what small fruit they reap  those men of little minds  who worship so  go where they worship  passing with their gods  but mine come unto me  blind are the eyes which deem th  unmanifested manifest  not comprehending me in my true self  imperishable  viewless  undeclared  hidden behind my magic veil of shows  i am not seen by all  i am not known   unborn and changeless  to the idle world  but i  arjuna  know all things which were  and all which are  and all which are to be  albeit not one among them knoweth me  by passion for the  pairs of opposites   by those twain snares of like and dislike  prince  all creatures live bewildered  save some few who  quit of sins  holy in act  informed  freed from the  opposites  and fixed in faith  cleave unto me  who cleave  who seek in me refuge from birth and death  those have the truth  those know me brahma  know me soul of souls  the adhyatman  know karma  my work  know i am adhibhuta  lord of life  and adhidaiva  lord of all the gods  and adhiyajna  lord of sacrifice  worship me well  with hearts of love and faith  and find and hold me in the hour of death  arjuna  who is that brahma  what that soul of souls  the adhyatman  what  thou best of all  thy work  the karma  tell me what it is thou namest adhibhuta  what again means adhidaiva  yea  and how it comes thou canst be adhiyajna in thy flesh  slayer of madhu  further  make me know how good men find thee in the hour of death  krishna  i brahma am  the one eternal god  and adhyatman is my being s name  the soul of souls  what goeth forth from me  causing all life to live  is karma called  and  manifested in divided forms  i am the adhibhuta  lord of lives  and adhidaiva  lord of all the gods  because i am purusha  who begets  and adhiyajna  lord of sacrifice  i  speaking with thee in this body here   am  thou embodied one   for all the shrines flame unto me   and  at the hour of death  he that hath meditated me alone  in putting off his flesh  comes forth to me  enters into my being  doubt thou not  but  if he meditated otherwise at hour of death  in putting off the flesh  he goes to what he looked for  kunti s son  because the soul is fashioned to its like  have me  then  in thy heart always  and fight  thou too  when heart and mind are fixed on me  shalt surely come to me  all come who cleave with never wavering will of firmest faith  owning none other gods  all come to me  the uttermost  purusha  holiest  whoso hath known me  lord of sage and singer  ancient of days  of all the three worlds stay  boundless   but unto every atom bringer of that which quickens it  whoso  i say  hath known my form  which passeth mortal knowing  seen my effulgence  which no eye hath seen   than the sun s burning gold more brightly glowing  dispersing darkness   unto him hath been right life  and  in the hour when life is ending  with mind set fast and trustful piety  drawing still breath beneath calm brows unbending  in happy peace that faithful one doth die    in glad peace passeth to purusha s heaven  the place which they who read the vedas name aksharam   ultimate   whereto have striven saints and ascetics  their road is the same  that way  the highest way  goes he who shuts the gates of all his senses  locks desire safe in his heart  centres the vital airs upon his parting thought  steadfastly set  and  murmuring om  the sacred syllable   emblem of brahm  dies  meditating me  for who  none other gods regarding  looks ever to me  easily am i gained by such a yogi  and  attaining me  they fall not  those mahatmas  back to birth  to life  which is the place of pain  which ends  but take the way of utmost blessedness  the worlds  arjuna   even brahma s world   roll back again from death to life s unrest  but they  o kunti s son  that reach to me  taste birth no more  if ye know brahma s day which is a thousand yugas  if ye know the thousand yugas making brahma s night  then know ye day and night as he doth know  when that vast dawn doth break  th  invisible is brought anew into the visible  when that deep night doth darken  all which is fades back again to him who sent it forth  yea  this vast company of living things   again and yet again produced  expires at brahma s nightfall  and  at brahma s dawn  riseth  without its will  to life new born  but  higher  deeper  innermost  abides another life  not like the life of sense  escaping sight  unchanging  this endures when all created things have passed away  this is that life named the unmanifest  the infinite  the all  the uttermost  thither arriving none return  that life is mine  and i am there  and  prince  by faith which wanders not  there is a way to come thither  i  the purusha  i who spread the universe around me  in whom dwell all living things  may so be reached and seen  richer than holy fruit on vedas growing  greater than gifts  better than prayer or fast  such wisdom is  the yogi  this way knowing  comes to the utmost perfect peace at last  krishna  now will i open unto thee  whose heart rejects not  that last lore  deepest concealed  that farthest secret of my heavens and earths  which but to know shall set thee free from ills    a royal lore  a kingly mystery  yea  for the soul such light as purgeth it from every sin  a light of holiness with inmost splendour shining  plain to see  easy to walk by  inexhaustible  they that receive not this  failing in faith to grasp the greater wisdom  reach not me  destroyer of thy foes  they sink anew into the realm of flesh  where all things change  by me the whole vast universe of things is spread abroad   by me  the unmanifest  in me are all existences contained  not i in them  yet they are not contained  those visible things  receive and strive to embrace the mystery majestical  my being   creating all  sustaining all  still dwells outside of all  see  as the shoreless airs move in the measureless space  but are not space   and space were space without the moving airs   so all things are in me  but are not i  at closing of each kalpa  indian prince  all things which be back to my being come  at the beginning of each kalpa  all issue new born from me  by energy and help of prakriti my outer self  again  and yet again  i make go forth the realms of visible things  without their will   all of them  by the power of prakriti   yet these great makings  prince  involve me not enchain me not  i sit apart from them  other  and higher  and free  nowise attached  thus doth the stuff of worlds  moulded by me  bring forth all that which is  moving or still  living or lifeless  thus the worlds go on  the minds untaught mistake me  veiled in form    naught see they of my secret presence  nought of my hid nature  ruling all which lives  vain hopes pursuing  vain deeds doing  fed on vainest knowledge  senselessly they seek an evil way  the way of brutes and fiends  but my mahatmas  those of noble soul who tread the path celestial  worship me with hearts unwandeing   knowing me the source  th  eternal source  of life  unendingly they glorify me  seek me  keep their vows of reverence and love  with changeless faith adoring me  yea  and those too adore  who  offering sacrifice of wakened hearts  have sense of one pervading spirit s stress  one force in every place  though manifold  i am the sacrifice  i am the prayer  i am the funeral cake set for the dead  i am the healing herb  i am the ghee  the mantra  and the flame  and that which burns  i am of all this boundless universe  the father  mother  ancestor

heaven s rain is mine to grant or to withhold  death am i  and immortal life i am  arjuna  sat and asat  visible life  and life invisible  yea  those who learn the threefold veds  who drink the soma wine  purge sins  pay sacrifice  from me they earn passage to swarga  where the meats divine of great gods feed them in high indra s heaven  yet they  when that prodigious joy is o er  paradise spent  and wage for merits given  come to the world of death and change once more  they had their recompense  they stored their treasure  following the threefold scripture and its writ  who seeketh such gaineth the fleeting pleasure of joy which comes and goes  i grant them it  but to those blessed ones who worship me  turning not otherwhere  with minds set fast  i bring assurance of full bliss beyond  nay  and of hearts which follow other gods in simple faith  their prayers arise to me  o kunti s son  though they pray wrongfully  for i am the receiver and the lord of every sacrifice  which these know not rightfully  so they fall to earth again   who follow gods go to their gods  who vow their souls to pitris go to pitris  minds to evil bhuts given o er sink to the bhuts  and whoso loveth me cometh to me  whoso shall offer me in faith and love a leaf  a flower  a fruit  water poured forth  that offering i accept  lovingly made with pious will  whate er thou doest  prince  eating or sacrificing  giving gifts  praying or fasting  let it all be done for me  as mine  so shalt thou free thyself from karmabandh  the chain which holdeth men to good and evil issue  so shalt come safe unto me when thou art quit of flesh   by faith and abdication joined to me  i am alike for all  i know not hate  i know not favour  what is made is mine  but them that worship me with love  i love  they are in me  and i in them  nay  prince  if one of evil life turn in his thought straightly to me  count him amidst the good  he hath the high way chosen  he shall grow righteous ere long  he shall attain that peace which changes not  thou prince of india  be certain none can perish  trusting me  o pritha s son  whoso will turn to me  though they be born from the very womb of sin  woman or man  sprung of the vaisya caste or lowly disregarded sudra   all plant foot upon the highest path  how then the holy brahmans and my royal saints  ah  ye who into this ill world are come   fleeting and false  set your faith fast on me  fix heart and thought on me  adore me  bring offerings to me  make me prostrations  make me your supremest joy  and  undivided  unto my rest your spirits shall be

all  for thou art all  yea  thou  ah  if in anger now thou shouldst remember i did think thee friend  speaking with easy speech  as men use each to each  did call thee  krishna    prince   nor comprehend thy hidden majesty  the might  the awe of thee  did  in my heedlessness  or in my love  on journey  or in jest  or when we lay at rest  sitting at council  straying in the grove  alone  or in the throng  do thee  most holy  wrong  be thy grace granted for that witless sin  for thou art  now i know  father of all below  of all above  of all the worlds within guru of gurus  more to reverence and adore than all which is adorable and high   how  in the wide worlds three should any equal be  should any other share thy majesty  therefore  with body bent and reverent intent  i praise  and serve  and seek thee  asking grace  as father to a son  as friend to friend  as one who loveth to his lover  turn thy face in gentleness on me  good is it i did see this unknown marvel of thy form  but fear mingles with joy  retake  dear lord  for pity s sake thine earthly shape  which earthly eyes may bear  be merciful  and show the visage that i know  let me regard thee  as of yore  arrayed with disc and forehead gem  with mace and anadem  thou that sustainest all things  undismayed let me once more behold the form i loved of old  thou of the thousand arms and countless eyes  this frightened heart is fain to see restored again my charioteer  in krishna s kind disguise  krishna  yea  thou hast seen  arjuna  because i loved thee well  the secret countenance of me  revealed by mystic spell  shining  and wonderful  and vast  majestic  manifold  which none save thou in all the years had favour to behold  for not by vedas cometh this  nor sacrifice  nor alms  nor works well done  nor penance long  nor prayers  nor chaunted psalms  that mortal eyes should bear to view the immortal soul unclad  prince of the kurus  this was kept for thee alone  be glad  let no more trouble shake thy heart  because thine eyes have seen my terror with my glory  as i before have been so will i be again for thee  with lightened heart behold  once more i am thy krishna  the form thou knew st of old  sanjaya  these words to arjuna spake vasudev  and straight did take back again the semblance dear of the well loved charioteer  peace and joy it did restore when the prince beheld once more mighty brahma s form and face clothed in krishna s gentle grace  arjuna  now that i see come back  janardana  this friendly human frame  my mind can think calm thoughts once more  my heart beats still again  krishna  yea  it was wonderful and terrible to view me as thou didst  dear prince  the gods dread and desire continually to view  yet not by vedas  nor from sacrifice  nor penance  nor gift giving  nor with prayer shall any so behold  as thou hast seen  only by fullest service  perfect faith  and uttermost surrender am i known and seen  and entered into  indian prince  who doeth all for me  who findeth me in all  adoreth always  loveth all which i have made  and me  for love s sole end that man  arjuna  unto me doth wend  arjuna  lord  of the men who serve thee  true in heart   as god revealed  and of the men who serve  worshipping thee unrevealed  unbodied  far  which take the better way of faith and life  krishna  whoever serve me  as i show myself   constantly true  in full devotion fixed  those hold i very holy  but who serve   worshipping me the one  the invisible  the unrevealed  unnamed  unthinkable  uttermost  all pervading  highest  sure   who thus adore me  mastering their sense  of one set mind to all  glad in all good  these blessed souls come unto me  yet  hard the travail is for such as bend their minds to reach th  unmanifest that viewless path shall scarce be trod by man bearing the flesh  but whereso any doeth all his deeds renouncing self for me  full of me  fixed to serve only the highest  night and day musing on me  him will i swiftly lift forth from life s ocean of distress and death  whose soul clings fast to me  cling thou to me  clasp me with heart and mind  so shalt thou dwell surely with me on high  but if thy thought droops from such height  if thou be st weak to set body and soul upon me constantly  despair not  give me lower service  seek to reach me  worshipping with steadfast will  and  if thou canst not worship steadfastly  work for me  toil in works pleasing to me  for he that laboureth right for love of me shall finally attain  but  if in this thy faint heart fails  bring me thy failure  find refuge in me  let fruits of labour go  renouncing hope for me  with lowliest heart  so shalt thou come  for  though to know is more than diligence  yet worship better is than knowing  and renouncing better still  near to renunciation  very near   dwelleth eternal peace  who hateth nought of all which lives  living himself benign  compassionate  from arrogance exempt  exempt from love of self  unchangeable by good or ill  patient  contented  firm in faith  mastering himself  true to his word  seeking me  heart and soul  vowed unto me    that man i love  who troubleth not his kind  and is not troubled by them  clear of wrath  living too high for gladness  grief  or fear  that man i love  who  dwelling quiet eyed  stainless  serene  well balanced  unperplexed  working with me  yet from all works detached  that man i love  who  fixed in faith on me  dotes upon none  scorns none  rejoices not  and grieves not  letting good or evil hap light when it will  and when it will depart  that man i love  who  unto friend and foe keeping an equal heart  with equal mind bears shame and glory  with an equal peace takes heat and cold  pleasure and pain  abides quit of desires  hears praise or calumny in passionless restraint  unmoved by each  linked by no ties to earth  steadfast in me  that man i love  but most of all i love those happy ones to whom  tis life to live in single fervid faith and love unseeing  drinking the blessed amrit of my being  arjuna  now would i hear  o gracious kesava  of life which seems  and soul beyond  which sees  and what it is we know or think to know  krishna  yea  son of kunti  for this flesh ye see is kshetra  is the field where life disports  and that which views and knows it is the soul  kshetrajna  in all  fields   thou indian prince  i am kshetrajna  i am what surveys   only that knowledge knows which knows the known by the knower  what it is  that  field  of life  what qualities it hath  and whence it is  and why it changeth  and the faculty that wotteth it  the mightiness of this  and how it wotteth hear these things from me  the elements  the conscious life  the mind  the unseen vital force  the nine strange gates of the body  and the five domains of sense  desire  dislike  pleasure and pain  and thought deep woven  and persistency of being  these all are wrought on matter by the soul  humbleness  truthfulness  and harmlessness  patience and honour  reverence for the wise  purity  constancy  control of self  contempt of sense delights  self sacrifice  perception of the certitude of ill in birth  death  age  disease  suffering  and sin  detachment  lightly holding unto home  children  and wife  and all that bindeth men  an ever tranquil heart in fortunes good and fortunes evil  with a will set firm to worship me  me only  ceasing not  loving all solitudes  and shunning noise of foolish crowds  endeavours resolute to reach perception of the utmost soul  and grace to understand what gain it were so to attain   this is true wisdom  prince  and what is otherwise is ignorance  now will i speak of knowledge best to know  that truth which giveth man amrit to drink  the truth of him  the para brahm  the all  the uncreated   not asat  not sat  not form  nor the unformed  yet both  and more    whose hands are everywhere  and everywhere planted his feet  and everywhere his eyes beholding  and his ears in every place hearing  and all his faces everywhere enlightening and encompassing his worlds  glorified in the senses he hath given  yet beyond sense he is  sustaining all  yet dwells he unattached  of forms and modes master  yet neither form nor mode hath he  he is within all beings  and without   motionless  yet still moving  not discerned for subtlety of instant presence  close to all  to each  yet measurelessly far  not manifold  and yet subsisting still in all which lives  for ever to be known as the sustainer  yet  at the end of times  he maketh all to end  and re creates  the light of lights he is  in the heart of the dark shining eternally  wisdom he is and wisdom s way  and guide of all the wise  planted in every heart  so have i told of life s stuff  and the moulding  and the lore to comprehend  whoso  adoring me  perceiveth this  shall surely come to me  know thou that nature and the spirit both have no beginning  know that qualities and changes of them are by nature wrought  that nature puts to work the acting frame  but spirit doth inform it  and so cause feeling of pain and pleasure  spirit  linked to moulded matter  entereth into bond with qualities by nature framed  and  thus married to matter  breeds the birth again in good or evil yonis  yet is this yea  in its bodily prison   spirit pure  spirit supreme  surveying  governing  guarding  possessing  lord and master still purusha  ultimate  one soul with me   whoso thus knows himself  and knows his soul purusha  working through the qualities with nature s modes  the light hath come for him  whatever flesh he bears  never again shall he take on its load  some few there be by meditation find the soul in self self schooled  and some by long philosophy and holy life reach thither  some by works  some  never so attaining  hear of light from other lips  and seize  and cleave to it worshipping  yea  and those  to teaching true   overpass death  wherever  indian prince  life is  of moving things  or things unmoved  plant or still seed  know  what is there hath grown by bond of matter and of spirit  know he sees indeed who sees in all alike the living  lordly soul  the soul supreme  imperishable amid the perishing   for  whoso thus beholds  in every place  in every form  the same  one  living life  doth no more wrongfulness unto himself  but goes the highest road which brings to bliss  seeing  he sees  indeed  who sees that works are nature s wont  for soul to practise by acting  yet not the agent  sees the mass of separate living things  each of its kind   issue from one  and blend again to one  then hath he brahma  he attains  o prince  that ultimate  high spirit  uncreate  unqualified  even when it entereth flesh taketh no stain of acts  worketh in nought  like to the ethereal air  pervading all  which  for sheer subtlety  avoideth taint  the subtle soul sits everywhere  unstained  like to the light of the all piercing sun  which is not changed by aught it shines upon   the soul s light shineth pure in every place  and they who  by such eye of wisdom  see how matter  and what deals with it  divide  and how the spirit and the flesh have strife  those wise ones go the way which leads to life  krishna  yet farther will i open unto thee this wisdom of all wisdoms  uttermost  the which possessing  all my saints have passed to perfectness  on such high verities reliant  rising into fellowship with me  they are not born again at birth of kalpas  nor at pralyas suffer change  this universe the womb is where i plant seed of all lives  thence  prince of india  comes birth to all beings  whoso  kunti s son  mothers each mortal form  brahma conceives  and i am he that fathers  sending seed  sattwan  rajas  and tamas  so are named the qualities of nature   soothfastness    passion   and  ignorance   these three bind down the changeless spirit in the changeful flesh   whereof sweet  soothfastness   by purity living unsullied and enlightened  binds the sinless soul to happiness and truth  and passion  being kin to appetite  and breeding impulse and propensity  binds the embodied soul  o kunti s son  by tie of works  but ignorance  begot of darkness  blinding mortal men  binds down their souls to stupor  sloth  and drowsiness  yea  prince of india  soothfastness binds souls in pleasant wise to flesh  and passion binds by toilsome strain  but ignorance  which blots the beams of wisdom  binds the soul to sloth  passion and ignorance  once overcome  leave soothfastness  o bharata  where this with ignorance are absent  passion rules  and ignorance in hearts not good nor quick  when at all gateways of the body shines the lamp of knowledge  then may one see well soothfastness settled in that city reigns  where longing is  and ardour  and unrest  impulse to strive and gain  and avarice  those spring from passion  prince   engrained  and where darkness and dulness  sloth and stupor are   tis ignorance hath caused them  kuru chief  moreover  when a soul departeth  fixed in soothfastness  it goeth to the place   perfect and pure  of those that know all truth  if it departeth in set habitude of impulse  it shall pass into the world of spirits tied to works  and  if it dies in hardened ignorance  that blinded soul is born anew in some unlighted womb  the fruit of soothfastness is true and sweet  the fruit of lusts is pain and toil  the fruit of ignorance is deeper darkness  yea  for light brings light  and passion ache to have  and gloom  bewilderments  and ignorance grow forth from ignorance  those of the first rise ever higher  those of the second mode take a mid place  the darkened souls sink back to lower deeps  loaded with witlessness  when  watching life  the living man perceives the only actors are the qualities  and knows what rules beyond the qualities  then is he come nigh unto me  the soul  thus passing forth from the three qualities   whereby arise all bodies  overcomes birth  death  sorrow  and age  and drinketh deep the undying wine of amrit  arjuna  oh  my lord  which be the signs to know him that hath gone past the three modes  how liveth he  what way leadeth him safe beyond the threefold modes  krishna  he who with equanimity surveys lustre of goodness  strife of passion  sloth of ignorance  not angry if they are  not wishful when they are not  he who sits a sojourner and stranger in their midst unruffled  standing off  saying  serene   when troubles break   these be the qualities   he unto whom  self centred  grief and joy sound as one word  to whose deep seeing eyes the clod  the marble  and the gold are one  whose equal heart holds the same gentleness for lovely and unlovely things  firm set  well pleased in praise and dispraise  satisfied with honour or dishonour  unto friends and unto foes alike in tolerance  detached from undertakings   he is named surmounter of the qualities  and such   with single  fervent faith adoring me  passing beyond the qualities  conforms to brahma  and attains me  for i am that whereof brahma is the likeness  mine the amrit is  and immortality is mine  and mine perfect felicity  krishna  men call the aswattha   the banyan tree    which hath its boughs beneath  its roots above    the ever holy tree  yea  for its leaves are green and waving hymns which whisper truth  who knows the aswattha  knows veds  and all  its branches shoot to heaven and sink to earth  even as the deeds of men  which take their birth from qualities  its silver sprays and blooms  and all the eager verdure of its girth  leap to quick life at kiss of sun and air  as men s lives quicken to the temptings fair of wooing sense  its hanging rootlets seek the soil beneath  helping to hold it there  as actions wrought amid this world of men bind them by ever tightening bonds again  if ye knew well the teaching of the tree  what its shape saith  and whence it springs  and  then how it must end  and all the ills of it  the axe of sharp detachment ye would whet  and cleave the clinging snaky roots  and lay this aswattha of sense life low   to set new growths upspringing to that happier sky    which they who reach shall have no day to die  nor fade away  nor fall  to him  i mean  father and first  who made the mystery of old creation  for to him come they from passion and from dreams who break away  who part the bonds constraining them to flesh  and   him  the highest  worshipping alway   no longer grow at mercy of what breeze of summer pleasure stirs the sleeping trees  what blast of tempest tears them  bough and stem to the eternal world pass such as these  another sun gleams there  another moon  another light   not dusk  nor dawn  nor noon   which they who once behold return no more  they have attained my rest  life s utmost boon  when  in this world of manifested life  the undying spirit  setting forth from me  taketh on form  it draweth to itself from being s storehouse   which containeth all    senses and intellect  the sovereign soul thus entering the flesh  or quitting it  gathers these up  as the wind gathers scents  blowing above the flower beds  ear and eye  and touch and taste  and smelling  these it takes    yea  and a sentient mind   linking itself to sense things so  the unenlightened ones mark not that spirit when he goes or comes  nor when he takes his pleasure in the form  conjoined with qualities  but those see plain who have the eyes to see  holy souls see which strive thereto  enlightened  they perceive that spirit in themselves  but foolish ones  even though they strive  discern not  having hearts unkindled  ill informed  know  too  from me shineth the gathered glory of the suns which lighten all the world  from me the moons draw silvery beams  and fire fierce loveliness  i penetrate the clay  and lend all shapes their living force  i glide into the plant   root  leaf  and bloom  to make the woodlands green with springing sap  becoming vital warmth  i glow in glad  respiring frames  and pass  with outward and with inward breath  to feed the body by all meats  for in this world being is twofold  the divided  one  the undivided  one  all things that live are  the divided   that which sits apart   the undivided   higher still is he  the highest  holding all  whose name is lord  the eternal  sovereign  first  who fills all worlds  sustaining them  and  dwelling thus beyond divided being and undivided  i am called of men and vedas  life supreme  the purushottama  who knows me thus  with mind unclouded  knoweth all  dear prince  and with his whole soul ever worshippeth me  now is the sacred  secret mystery declared to thee  who comprehendeth this hath wisdom  he is quit of works in bliss  krishna  fearlessness  singleness of soul  the will always to strive for wisdom  opened hand and governed appetites  and piety  and love of lonely study  humbleness  uprightness  heed to injure nought which lives  truthfulness  slowness unto wrath  a mind that lightly letteth go what others prize  and equanimity  and charity which spieth no man s faults  and tenderness towards all that suffer  a contented heart  fluttered by no desires  a bearing mild  modest  and grave  with manhood nobly mixed  with patience  fortitude  and purity  an unrevengeful spirit  never given to rate itself too high   such be the signs  o indian prince  of him whose feet are set on that fair path which leads to heavenly birth  deceitfulness  and arrogance  and pride  quickness to anger  harsh and evil speech  and ignorance  to its own darkness blind    these be the signs  my prince  of him whose birth is fated for the regions of the vile  the heavenly birth brings to deliverance  so should st thou know  the birth with asuras brings into bondage  be thou joyous  prince  whose lot is set apart for heavenly birth  two stamps there are marked on all living men  divine and undivine  i spake to thee by what marks thou shouldst know the heavenly man  hear from me now of the unheavenly  they comprehend not  the unheavenly  how souls go forth from me  nor how they come back unto me  nor is there truth in these  nor purity  nor rule of life   this world hath not a law  nor order  nor a lord   so say they   nor hath risen up by cause following on cause  in perfect purposing  but is none other than a house of lust   and  this thing thinking  all those ruined ones   of little wit  dark minded  give themselves to evil deeds  the curses of their kind  surrendered to desires insatiable  full of deceitfulness  folly  and pride  in blindness cleaving to their errors  caught into the sinful course  they trust this lie as it were true  this lie which leads to death   finding in pleasure all the good which is  and crying  here it finisheth   ensnared in nooses of a hundred idle hopes  slaves to their passion and their wrath  they buy wealth with base deeds  to glut hot appetites   thus much  to day   they say   we gained  thereby such and such wish of heart shall have its fill  and this is ours  and th  other shall be ours  to day we slew a foe  and we will slay our other enemy to morrow  look  are we not lords  make we not goodly cheer  is not our fortune famous  brave  and great  rich are we  proudly born  what other men live like to us  kill  then  for sacrifice  cast largesse  and be merry   so they speak darkened by ignorance  and so they fall   tossed to and fro with projects  tricked  and bound in net of black delusion  lost in lusts   down to foul naraka  conceited  fond  stubborn and proud  dead drunken with the wine of wealth  and reckless  all their offerings have but a show of reverence  being not made in piety of ancient faith  thus vowed to self hood  force  insolence  feasting  wrath  these my blasphemers  in the forms they wear and in the forms they breed  my foemen are  hateful and hating  cruel  evil  vile  lowest and least of men  whom i cast down again  and yet again  at end of lives  into some devilish womb  whence  birth by birth   the devilish wombs re spawn them  all beguiled  and  till they find and worship me  sweet prince  tread they that nether road  the doors of hell are threefold  whereby men to ruin pass    the door of lust  the door of wrath  the door of avarice  let a man shun those three  he who shall turn aside from entering all those three gates of narak  wendeth straight to find his peace  and comes to swarga s gate  arjuna  if men forsake the holy ordinance  heedless of shastras  yet keep faith at heart and worship  what shall be the state of those  great krishna  sattwan  rajas  tamas  say  krishna  threefold the faith is of mankind and springs from those three qualities   becoming  true   or  passion stained   or  dark   as thou shalt hear  the faith of each believer  indian prince  conforms itself to what he truly is  where thou shalt see a worshipper  that one to what he worships lives assimilate  such as the shrine  so is the votary   the  soothfast  souls adore true gods  the souls obeying rajas worship rakshasas or yakshas  and the men of darkness pray to pretas and to bhutas  yea  and those who practise bitter penance  not enjoined by rightful rule  penance which hath its root in self sufficient  proud hypocrisies   those men  passion beset  violent  wild  torturing  the witless ones  my elements shut in fair company within their flesh   nay  me myself  present within the flesh   know them to devils devoted  not to heaven  for like as foods are threefold for mankind in nourishing  so is there threefold way of worship  abstinence  and almsgiving  hear this of me  there is a food which brings force  substance  strength  and health  and joy to live  being well seasoned  cordial  comforting  the  soothfast  meat  and there be foods which bring aches and unrests  and burning blood  and grief  being too biting  heating  salt  and sharp  and therefore craved by too strong appetite  and there is foul food  kept from over night  savourless  filthy  which the foul will eat  a feast of rottenness  meet for the lips of such as love the  darkness   thus with rites    a sacrifice not for rewardment made  offered in rightful wise  when he who vows sayeth  with heart devout   this i should do   is  soothfast  rite  but sacrifice for gain  offered for good repute  be sure that this  o best of bharatas  is rajas rite  with stamp of  passion   and a sacrifice offered against the laws  with no due dole of food giving  with no accompaniment of hallowed hymn  nor largesse to the priests  in faithless celebration  call it vile  the deed of  darkness    lost  worship of gods meriting worship  lowly reverence of twice borns  teachers  elders  purity  rectitude  and the brahmacharya s vow  and not to injure any helpless thing     these make a true religiousness of act  words causing no man woe  words ever true  gentle and pleasing words  and those ye say in murmured reading of a sacred writ    these make the true religiousness of speech  serenity of soul  benignity  sway of the silent spirit  constant stress to sanctify the nature   these things make good rite  and true religiousness of mind  such threefold faith  in highest piety kept  with no hope of gain  by hearts devote  is perfect work of sattwan  true belief  religion shown in act of proud display to win good entertainment  worship  fame  such  say i  is of rajas  rash and vain  religion followed by a witless will to torture self  or come at power to hurt another    tis of tamas  dark and ill  the gift lovingly given  when one shall say  now must i gladly give   when he who takes can render nothing back  made in due place  due time  and to a meet recipient  is gift of sattwan  fair and profitable  the gift selfishly given  where to receive is hoped again  or when some end is sought  or where the gift is proffered with a grudge  this is of rajas  stained with impulse  ill  the gift churlishly flung  at evil time  in wrongful place  to base recipient  made in disdain or harsh unkindliness  is gift of tamas  dark  it doth not bless  arjuna  fain would i better know  thou glorious one  the very truth  heart s lord   of sannyas  abstention  and enunciation  lord  tyaga  and what separates these twain  krishna  the poets rightly teach that sannyas is the foregoing of all acts which spring out of desire  and their wisest say tyaga is renouncing fruit of acts  there be among the saints some who have held all action sinful  and to be renounced  and some who answer   nay  the goodly acts   as worship  penance  alms  must be performed   hear now my sentence  best of bharatas   tis well set forth  o chaser of thy foes  renunciation is of threefold form  and worship  penance  alms  not to be stayed  nay  to be gladly done  for all those three are purifying waters for true souls  yet must be practised even those high works in yielding up attachment  and all fruit produced by works  this is my judgment  prince  this my insuperable and fixed decree  abstaining from a work by right prescribed never is meet  so to abstain doth spring from  darkness   and delusion teacheth it  abstaining from a work grievous to flesh  when one saith   tis unpleasing   this is null  such an one acts from  passion   nought of gain wins his renunciation  but  arjun  abstaining from attachment to the work  abstaining from rewardment in the work  while yet one doeth it full faithfully  saying   tis right to do   that is  true   act and abstinence  who doeth duties so  unvexed if his work fail  if it succeed unflattered  in his own heart justified  quit of debates and doubts  his is  true  act  for  being in the body  none may stand wholly aloof from act  yet  who abstains from profit of his acts is abstinent  the fruit of labours  in the lives to come  is threefold for all men   desirable  and undesirable  and mixed of both  but no fruit is at all where no work was  hear from me  long armed lord  the makings five which go to every act  in sankhya taught as necessary  first the force  and then the agent  next  the various instruments  fourth  the especial effort  fifth  the god  what work soever any mortal doth of body  mind  or speech  evil or good  by these five doth he that  which being thus  whoso  for lack of knowledge  seeth himself as the sole actor  knoweth nought at all and seeth nought  therefore  i say  if one   holding aloof from self  with unstained mind should slay all yonder host  being bid to slay  he doth not slay  he is not bound thereby  knowledge  the thing known  and the mind which knows  these make the threefold starting ground of act  the act  the actor  and the instrument  these make the threefold total of the deed  but knowledge  agent  act  are differenced by three dividing qualities  hear now which be the qualities dividing them  there is  true  knowledge  learn thou it is this  to see one changeless life in all the lives  and in the separate  one inseparable  there is imperfect knowledge  that which sees the separate existences apart  and  being separated  holds them real  there is false knowledge  that which blindly clings to one as if  twere all  seeking no cause  deprived of light  narrow  and dull  and  dark   there is  right  action  that which being enjoined   is wrought without attachment  passionlessly  for duty  not for love  nor hate  nor gain  there is  vain  action  that which men pursue aching to satisfy desires  impelled by sense of self  with all absorbing stress  this is of rajas  passionate and vain  there is  dark  action  when one doth a thing heedless of issues  heedless of the hurt or wrong for others  heedless if he harm his own soul   tis of tamas  black and bad  there is the  rightful doer  he who acts free from self seeking  humble  resolute  steadfast  in good or evil hap the same  content to do aright he  truly  acts  there is th   impassioned  doer  he that works from impulse  seeking profit  rude and bold to overcome  unchastened  slave by turns of sorrow and of joy  of rajas he  and there be evil doers  loose of heart  low minded  stubborn  fraudulent  remiss  dull  slow  despondent  children of the  dark   hear  too  of intellect and steadfastness the threefold separation  conqueror prince  how these are set apart by qualities  good is the intellect which comprehends the coming forth and going back of life  what must be done  and what must not be done  what should be feared  and what should not be feared  what binds and what emancipates the soul  that is of sattwan  prince  of  soothfastness   marred is the intellect which  knowing right and knowing wrong  and what is well to do and what must not be done  yet understands nought with firm mind  nor as the calm truth is  this is of rajas  prince  and  passionate   evil is intellect which  wrapped in gloom  looks upon wrong as right  and sees all things contrariwise of truth  o pritha s son  that is of tamas   dark  and desperate  good is the steadfastness whereby a man masters his beats of heart  his very breath of life  the action of his senses  fixed in never shaken faith and piety  that is of sattwan  prince   soothfast  and fair  stained is the steadfastness whereby a man holds to his duty  purpose  effort  end  for life s sake  and the love of goods to gain  arjuna   tis of rajas  passion stamped  sad is the steadfastness wherewith the fool cleaves to his sloth  his sorrow  and his fears  his folly and despair  this  pritha s son    is born of tamas   dark  and miserable  hear further  chief of bharatas  from me the threefold kinds of pleasure which there be  good pleasure is the pleasure that endures  banishing pain for aye  bitter at first as poison to the soul  but afterward sweet as the taste of amrit  drink of that  it springeth in the spirit s deep content  and painful pleasure springeth from the bond between the senses and the sense world  sweet as amrit is its first taste  but its last bitter as poison   tis of rajas  prince  and foul and  dark  the pleasure is which springs from sloth and sin and foolishness  at first and at the last  and all the way of life the soul bewildering   tis of tamas  prince  for nothing lives on earth  nor  midst the gods in utmost heaven  but hath its being bound with these three qualities  by nature framed  the work of brahmans  kshatriyas  vaisyas  and sudras  o thou slayer of thy foes  is fixed by reason of the qualities planted in each  a brahman s virtues  prince  born of his nature  are serenity  self mastery  religion  purity  patience  uprightness  learning  and to know the truth of things which be  a kshatriya s pride  born of his nature  lives in valour  fire  constancy  skilfulness  spirit in fight  and open handedness and noble mien  as of a lord of men  a vaisya s task  born with his nature  is to till the ground  tend cattle  venture trade  a sudra s state  suiting his nature  is to minister  whoso performeth  diligent  content   the work allotted him  whate er it be  lays hold of perfectness  hear how a man findeth perfection  being so content  he findeth it through worship  wrought by work   of him that is the source of all which lives  of him by whom the universe was stretched  better thine own work is  though done with fault  than doing others  work  ev n excellently  he shall not fall in sin who fronts the task set him by nature s hand  let no man leave his natural duty  prince  though it bear blame  for every work hath blame  as every flame is wrapped in smoke  only that man attains perfect surcease of work whose work was wrought with mind unfettered  soul wholly subdued  desires for ever dead  results renounced  learn from me  son of kunti  also this  how one  attaining perfect peace  attains brahm  the supreme  the highest height of all  devoted  with a heart grown pure  restrained in lordly self control  forgoing wiles of song and senses  freed from love and hate  dwelling  mid solitudes  in diet spare  with body  speech  and will tamed to obey  ever to holy meditation vowed  from passions liberate  quit of the self  of arrogance  impatience  anger  pride  freed from surroundings  quiet  lacking nought   such an one grows to oneness with the brahm  such an one  growing one with brahm  serene  sorrows no more  desires no more  his soul  equally loving all that lives  loves well me  who have made them  and attains to me  by this same love and worship doth he know me as i am  how high and wonderful  and knowing  straightway enters into me  and whatsoever deeds he doeth  fixed in me  as in his refuge  he hath won for ever and for ever by my grace th  eternal rest  so win thou  in thy thoughts do all thou dost for me  renounce for me  sacrifice heart and mind and will to me  live in the faith of me  in faith of me all dangers thou shalt vanquish  by my grace  but  trusting to thyself and heeding not  thou can st but perish  if this day thou say st  relying on thyself   i will not fight   vain will the purpose prove  thy qualities would spur thee to the war  what thou dost shun  misled by fair illusions  thou wouldst seek against thy will  when the task comes to thee waking the promptings in thy nature set  there lives a master in the hearts of men maketh their deeds  by subtle pulling  strings  dance to what tune he will  with all thy soul trust him  and take him for thy succour  prince  so  only so  arjuna   shalt thou gain   by grace of him  the uttermost repose  the eternal place  thus hath been opened thee this truth of truths  the mystery more hid than any secret mystery  meditate  and  as thou wilt  then act  nay  but once more take my last word  my utmost meaning have  precious thou art to me  right well beloved  listen  i tell thee for thy comfort this  give me thy heart  adore me  serve me  cling in faith and love and reverence to me  so shalt thou come to me  i promise true  for thou art sweet to me  and let go those   rites and writ duties  fly to me alone  make me thy single refuge  i will free thy soul from all its sins  be of good cheer   hide  the holy krishna saith  this from him that hath no faith  him that worships not  nor seeks wisdom s teaching when she speaks  hide it from all men who mock  but  wherever   mid the flock of my lovers  one shall teach this divinest  wisest  speech   teaching in the faith to bring truth to them  and offering of all honour unto me   unto brahma cometh he  nay  and nowhere shall ye find any man of all mankind doing dearer deed for me  nor shall any dearer be in my earth  yea  furthermore  whoso reads this converse o er  held by us upon the plain  pondering piously and fain  he hath paid me sacrifice   krishna speaketh in this wise   yea  and whoso  full of faith  heareth wisely what it saith  heareth meekly   when he dies  surely shall his spirit rise to those regions where the blest  free of flesh  in joyance rest   hath this been heard by thee  o indian prince  with mind intent  hath all the ignorance   which bred thy trouble  vanished  my arjun  arjuna  trouble and ignorance are gone  the light hath come unto me  by thy favour  lord  now am i fixed  my doubt is fled away  according to thy word  so will i do  sanjaya  thus gathered i the gracious speech of krishna  o my king  thus have i told  with heart a thrill  this wise and wondrous thing by great vyasa s learning writ  how krishna s self made known the yoga  being yoga s lord  so is the high truth shown  and aye  when i remember  o lord my king  again arjuna and the god in talk  and all this holy strain  great is my gladness  when i muse that splendour  passing speech  of hari  visible and plain  there is no tongue to reach my marvel and my love and bliss  o archer prince  all hail  o krishna  lord of yoga  surely there shall not fail blessing  and victory  and power  for thy most mighty sake  where this song comes of arjun  and how with god he spake '
