6,CHAPTER I,1.0,7.0," Arjuna. Krishna! as I behold, come here to shed Their common blood, yon concourse of our kin, My members fail, my tongue dries in my mouth, A shudder thrills my body, and my hair Bristles with horror; from my weak hand slips Gandiv, the goodly bow; a fever burns My skin to parching; hardly may I stand; The life within me seems to swim and faint; Nothing do I foresee save woe and wail! It is not good, O Keshav! nought of good Can spring from mutual slaughter! Lo, I hate Triumph and domination, wealth and ease, Thus sadly won! Aho! what victory Can bring delight, Govinda! what rich spoils Could profit; what rule recompense; what span Of life itself seem sweet, bought with such blood? Seeing that these stand here, ready to die, For whose sake life was fair, and pleasure pleased, And power grew precious:-grandsires, sires, and sons, Brothers, and fathers-in-law, and sons-in-law, Elders and friends! Shall I deal death on these Even though they seek to slay us? Not one blow, O Madhusudan! will I strike to gain The rule of all Three Worlds; then, how much less To seize an earthly kingdom! Killing these Must breed but anguish, Krishna! If they be Guilty, we shall grow guilty by their deaths; Their sins will light on us, if we shall slay Those sons of Dhritirashtra, and our kin; What peace could come of that, O Madhava? For if indeed, blinded by lust and wrath, These cannot see, or will not see, the sin Of kingly lines o'erthrown and kinsmen slain, How should not we, who see, shun such a crime-- We who perceive the guilt and feel the shame-- O thou Delight of Men, Janardana? By overthrow of houses perisheth Their sweet continuous household piety, And-rites neglected, piety extinct-- Enters impiety upon that home; Its women grow unwomaned, whence there spring Mad passions, and the mingling-up of castes, Sending a Hell-ward road that family, And whoso wrought its doom by wicked wrath. Nay, and the souls of honoured ancestors Fall from their place of peace, being bereft Of funeral-cakes and the wan death-water. So teach our holy hymns. Thus, if we slay Kinsfolk and friends for love of earthly power, Ahovat! what an evil fault it were! Better I deem it, if my kinsmen strike, To face them weaponless, and bare my breast To shaft and spear, than answer blow with blow. So speaking, in the face of those two hosts, Arjuna sank upon his chariot-seat, And let fall bow and arrows, sick at heart.", arjuna  krishna  as i behold  come here to shed their common blood  yon concourse of our kin  my members fail  my tongue dries in my mouth  a shudder thrills my body  and my hair bristles with horror  from my weak hand slips gandiv  the goodly bow  a fever burns my skin to parching  hardly may i stand  the life within me seems to swim and faint  nothing do i foresee save woe and wail  it is not good  o keshav  nought of good can spring from mutual slaughter  lo  i hate triumph and domination  wealth and ease  thus sadly won  aho  what victory can bring delight  govinda  what rich spoils could profit  what rule recompense  what span of life itself seem sweet  bought with such blood  seeing that these stand here  ready to die  for whose sake life was fair  and pleasure pleased  and power grew precious  grandsires  sires  and sons  brothers  and fathers in law  and sons in law  elders and friends  shall i deal death on these even though they seek to slay us  not one blow  o madhusudan  will i strike to gain the rule of all three worlds  then  how much less to seize an earthly kingdom  killing these must breed but anguish  krishna  if they be guilty  we shall grow guilty by their deaths  their sins will light on us  if we shall slay those sons of dhritirashtra  and our kin  what peace could come of that  o madhava  for if indeed  blinded by lust and wrath  these cannot see  or will not see  the sin of kingly lines o erthrown and kinsmen slain  how should not we  who see  shun such a crime   we who perceive the guilt and feel the shame   o thou delight of men  janardana  by overthrow of houses perisheth their sweet continuous household piety  and rites neglected  piety extinct   enters impiety upon that home  its women grow unwomaned  whence there spring mad passions  and the mingling up of castes  sending a hell ward road that family  and whoso wrought its doom by wicked wrath  nay  and the souls of honoured ancestors fall from their place of peace  being bereft of funeral cakes and the wan death water  so teach our holy hymns  thus  if we slay kinsfolk and friends for love of earthly power  ahovat  what an evil fault it were  better i deem it  if my kinsmen strike  to face them weaponless  and bare my breast to shaft and spear  than answer blow with blow  so speaking  in the face of those two hosts  arjuna sank upon his chariot seat  and let fall bow and arrows  sick at heart

11,CHAPTER II,1.0,5.0," Krishna. Thou grievest where no grief should be! thou speak'st Words lacking wisdom! for the wise in heart Mourn not for those that live, nor those that die. Nor I, nor thou, nor any one of these, Ever was not, nor ever will not be, For ever and for ever afterwards. All, that doth live, lives always! To man's frame As there come infancy and youth and age, So come there raisings-up and layings-down Of other and of other life-abodes, Which the wise know, and fear not. This that irks-- Thy sense-life, thrilling to the elements-- Bringing thee heat and cold, sorrows and joys, 'Tis brief and mutable! Bear with it, Prince! As the wise bear. The soul which is not moved, The soul that with a strong and constant calm Takes sorrow and takes joy indifferently, Lives in the life undying! That which is Can never cease to be; that which is not Will not exist. To see this truth of both Is theirs who part essence from accident, Substance from shadow. Indestructible, Learn thou! the Life is, spreading life through all; It cannot anywhere, by any means, Be anywise diminished, stayed, or changed. But for these fleeting frames which it informs With spirit deathless, endless, infinite, They perish. Let them perish, Prince! and fight! He who shall say, ""Lo! I have slain a man!"" He who shall think, ""Lo! I am slain!"" those both Know naught! Life cannot slay. Life is not slain! Never the spirit was born; the spirit shall cease to be never; Never was time it was not; End and Beginning are dreams! Birthless and deathless and changeless remaineth the spirit for ever; Death hath not touched it at all, dead though the house of it seems! Who knoweth it exhaustless, self-sustained, Immortal, indestructible,--shall such Say, ""I have killed a man, or caused to kill?"" Nay, but as when one layeth His worn-out robes away, And taking new ones, sayeth, ""These will I wear to-day!"" So putteth by the spirit Lightly its garb of flesh, And passeth to inherit A residence afresh. I say to thee weapons reach not the Life; Flame burns it not, waters cannot o'erwhelm, Nor dry winds wither it. Impenetrable, Unentered, unassailed, unharmed, untouched, Immortal, all-arriving, stable, sure, Invisible, ineffable, by word And thought uncompassed, ever all itself, Thus is the Soul declared! How wilt thou, then,-- Knowing it so,--grieve when thou shouldst not grieve? How, if thou hearest that the man new-dead Is, like the man new-born, still living man-- One same, existent Spirit--wilt thou weep? The end of birth is death; the end of death Is birth: this is ordained! and mournest thou, Chief of the stalwart arm! for what befalls Which could not otherwise befall?
