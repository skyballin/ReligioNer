0,Introduction,1,1," This is the one and only way, monks, for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the extinguishing of suffering and grief, for walking on the path of truth, for the realisation of nibbāna: that is to say, the fourfold establishing of awareness. Which four? Here, monks, a monk dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, observing body in body, having removed craving and aversion towards the world [of mind and matter]; he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, observing sensations in sensations, having removed craving and aversion towards the world [of mind and matter]; he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, observing mind in mind, having removed craving and aversion towards the world [of mind and matter]; he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, observing mental contents in mental contents, having removed craving and aversion towards the world [of mind and matter].", this is the one and only way  monks  for the purification of beings  for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation  for the extinguishing of suffering and grief  for walking on the path of truth  for the realisation of nibb  na  that is to say  the fourfold establishing of awareness  which four  here  monks  a monk dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence  observing body in body  having removed craving and aversion towards the world  of mind and matter   he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence  observing sensations in sensations  having removed craving and aversion towards the world  of mind and matter   he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence  observing mind in mind  having removed craving and aversion towards the world  of mind and matter   he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence  observing mental contents in mental contents  having removed craving and aversion towards the world  of mind and matter  
1,The Observation of Body,2,1," Section on Respiration: And how, monks, does a monk dwell observing body in body? Here a monk, having gone into the forest, or to the foot of a tree, or to an empty room, sits down cross-legged, keeps his body upright and fixes his awareness in the area around the mouth. With this awareness, he breathes in, with this awareness, he breathes out. Breathing in a deep breath, he understands properly: ""I am breathing in a deep breath."" Breathing out a deep breath, he understands properly: ""I am breathing out a deep breath."" Breathing in a shallow breath, he understands properly: ""I am breathing in a shallow breath."" Breathing out a shallow breath, he understands properly: ""I am breathing out a shallow breath."" In this way he trains himself: ""Feeling the whole body, I shall breathe in."" ""Feeling the whole body, I shall breathe out,"" thus he trains himself. ""With the bodily activities calmed, I shall breathe in,"" thus he trains himself. ""With the bodily activities calmed, I shall breathe out,"" thus he trains himself. Just as a skilful turner or a turner’s apprentice, while making a long turn understands properly: ""I am making a long turn,"" and while making a short turn, understands properly: ""I am making a short turn,"" just so, the monk, breathing in a deep breath, understands properly: ""I am breathing in a deep breath."" Breathing in a shallow breath, he understands properly: ""I am breathing in a shallow breath."" Breathing out a deep breath, he understands properly: ""I am breathing out a deep breath."" Breathing out a shallow breath, he understands properly: ""I am breathing out a shallow breath."" In this way he trains himself: ""Feeling the whole body, I shall breathe in."" ""Feeling the whole body, I shall breathe out,"" thus he trains himself. ""With the bodily activities calmed, I shall breathe in,"" thus he trains himself. ""With the bodily activities calmed, I shall breathe out,"" thus he trains himself. Thus he dwells observing body in body internally, or he dwells observing body in body externally, or he dwells observing body in body both internally and externally. Thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of arising in the body, thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of passing away in the body, thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of arising and passing away in the body. Now his awareness is established: ""This is body!"" Thus he develops his awareness to such an extent that there is mere understanding along with mere awareness. In this way he dwells detached, without clinging towards anything in the world [of mind and matter].

With the subsiding of initial and sustained application of the mind and gaining inner tranquillity and oneness of mind he enters into the second absorption, born of concentration, free from initial and sustained application of the mind, filled with rapture and bliss and he dwells therein. After the fading away of rapture he dwells in equanimity, aware with constant thorough understanding of impermanence, and he experiences in his body the bliss of which the noble ones say: ""That bliss is experienced by one with equanimity and awareness."" Thus he enters the third absorption and dwells therein.

66,To Prince Abhaya,1,1," I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. Then Prince Abhaya went to Nigantha Nataputta and on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, Nigantha Nataputta said to him, ""Come, now, prince.

If the contemplative Gotama, thus asked, answers, 'The Tathágata would say words that are un-endearing and disagreeable to others,' then you should say, 'Then how is there any difference between you, venerable sir, and run-of-the-mill people? For even run-of-the-mill people say words that are un-endearing and disagreeable to others.' But if the contemplative Gotama, thus asked, answers, 'The Tathágata would not say words that are un-endearing and disagreeable to others,' then you should say, 'Then how, venerable sir, did you say of Devadatta that ""Devadatta is headed for destitution, Devadatta is headed for hell, Devadatta will boil for an eon, Devadatta is incurable""?

68,To Prince Abhaya,1,3," For Devadatta was upset and disgruntled at those words of yours.' When the contemplative Gotama is asked this two-pronged question by you, he won't be able to swallow it down or spit it up. Just as if a two-horned chestnut [1] were stuck in a man's throat: he would not be able to swallow it down or spit it up.

69,To Prince Abhaya,1,4," Responding, ""As you say, venerable sir,"" Prince Abhaya got up from his seat, bowed down to Nigantha Nataputta, circumambulated him, and then went to the Blessed One.

Tomorrow in my own home I will overturn the Blessed One's words.""

70,To Prince Abhaya,1,5," The Blessed One acquiesced with silence. Then Prince Abhaya, understanding the Blessed One's acquiescence, got up from his seat, bowed down to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and left. Then, after the night had passed, the Blessed One early in the morning put on his robes and, carrying his bowl and outer robe, went to Prince Abhaya's home. On arrival, he sat down on a seat made ready. Prince Abhaya, with his own hand, served and satisfied the Blessed One with fine staple and non-staple foods. Then, when the Blessed One had eaten and had removed his hand from his bowl, Prince Abhaya took a lower seat and sat down to one side.

They offer him humble service and salute him, rise and do him homage and pay him fitting service and just as the Sakyans offer the King humble service and salute him, rise and do him homage and pay him fitting service so likewise does the King offer humble service to the Tathágata, thinking, ""If the ascetic Gotama is well-born, I am ill-born; if the ascetic Gotama is strong, I am weak; if the ascetic Gotama is pleasant to look at, I am ill-favored; if the ascetic Gotama is influential, I am of little influence.""

Why is that? Because, Vasettha, this designates the Tathágata: ""The Body of Dhamma,"" that is ""The Body of Brahma,"" [3] or ""Become Dhamma,"" that is ""Become Brahma."" [4] ‘There comes a time, Vasettha, when, sooner or later after a long period this world contracts. At a time of contraction, beings are mostly born in the Abhassara Brahma world. And there they dwell, mind-made, feeding on delight, self luminous, moving through the air, glorious—and they stay like that for a very long time. But sooner or later, after a very long period, this world begins to expand again. At a time of expansion, the beings from the Abhassara Brahma world, having passed away from there, are mostly reborn in this world. Here they dwell, mind-made, feeding on delight, self-luminous, moving through the air, glorious—[5] and they stay like that for a very long time. ‘At that period, Vasettha, there was just one mass of water, and all was darkness, blinding darkness. Neither moon or sun appeared, no constellations or stars appeared, night and day were not yet distinguished, nor months and fortnights, nor years and seasons; there was no male and female, beings being reckoned just as beings. [6] And sooner or later, after a very long period of time, savory earth spread itself over the waters where those beings were. It looked just like the skin that forms itself over hot milk as it cools. It was endowed with color, smell, and taste. It was the color of fine ghee or butter and it was very sweet, like pure wild honey. ‘Then some being of a greedy nature said: ""I say, what can this be?"" and tasted the savory earth on its finger. In so doing, it became taken with the flavor, and craving arose in it. Then other beings, taking their cue from that one, also tasted the stuff with their fingers. They too were taken with the flavor, and craving arose in them. So they set to with their hands, breaking off pieces of the stuff in order to eat it. And the result was that their self luminance disappeared. And as a result of the disappearance of their self luminance the moon and the sun appeared, night and day were distinguished, months and fortnights appeared, and the year and its seasons.

288,Insult,1,4," Whence is there anger for one free from anger,  tamed,  living in tune -- one released through right knowing, calmed  and Such.

289,Insult,1,5," When this was said, the Brahmin Akkosaka Bharadvaja said to the Blessed One, ""Magnificent, Master Gautama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what had been overturned, were to reveal what was hidden, were to show the way to one who was lost, or were to hold up a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way Master Gautama has -- through many lines of reasoning -- made the Dhamma clear.

290,Insult,1,6," Then the Brahmin Akkosaka Bharadvaja received the going forth and the admission in the Blessed One's presence. And not long after his admission -- dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, and resolute -- he in no long time reached and remained in the supreme goal of the holy life, for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing and realizing it for himself in the here and now. He knew: ""Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world."" And so Ven. Bharadvaja became another one of the Arhats.

Yes, friends, as I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, to one who pursues those impedimental things declared, as impediments are not suitable impediments. Then those Bhikkhus thinking to dissuade the Bhikkhu Arittha from that evil view, cross questioned him, asked for reasons and discussed with him. Friend, Arittha do not say that, do not accuse the Blessed One. The Blessed One did not say that.

299,The Simile of the Snake,1,9," Bhikkhus, this Teaching is for giving up not for taking hold of, listen to it carefully. Like a man come to the highway would see a large stretch of water, the hither shore dangerous and fearful, the thither shore peaceful and without fear. There is no ship or overhead bridge to cross over from the hither shore to the thither. What if I build a raft collecting grass, sticks, branches and creepers. So he built a raft collecting grass sticks branches and creepers, and making effort with hands and feet reached the other shore safely. Then to the one who has crossed over this thought occurred This raft was of great service to me, I safely crossed over to the other shore boarding it and putting forth effort with my hands and feet. What if I balance it on my head or haul it on my back and go where I like. Bhikkhus, is he doing the right thing if he does so with the raft.- Doing what will he be doing the right thing with the raft.. Bhikkhus, to the man who has crossed over it occurs thus: This raft was of great service to me, I safely crossed over to the other shore boarding it and putting forth effort with my hands and feet. What if I pulled it up to dry ground , or sink it in the water and go where I like. A man doing that would be doing the right thing.

300,The Simile of the Snake,1,10," Bhikkhus, these six are the views. What six. Bhikkhus, the ordinary man who has not seen the noble ones and Great Beings, not clever in their Teaching, and not trained in their Teaching Sees matter: that is me, I am that, that is my self. Sees feelings,; that is me, I am that, that is my self. Sees determinations: that is me, I am that, that is my self. Whatever seen, heard, tasted, smelt and bodily felt, cognized, attained, sought after, and reflected in the mind: that is me, I am that, that is my self The world, the self, I will be in the future, permanent, not changing, an eternal thing.; that is me, I am that, that is my self. Bhikkhus, the learned noble disciple, who has seen noble ones and Great Beings, clever in their Teaching, and trained in their Teaching sees matter: that is not me, am not that, that is not my self. Sees feelings: that is not me ,am not that, that is not my self. Sees determinations: that is not me am not that, that is not my self, Whatever seen, heard, tasted, smelt, bodily felt, cognized, attained, sought after, and reflected in the mind: that is not me, am not that, that is not my self. The world, the self, I will be in the future, permanent, not changing, an eternal thing, that is not me, am not that, that is not my self.. Seeing it is not present, is not excited. . When this was said, a certain Bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: Venerable sir, is there excitement for external non presence. The Blessed One said, there is Bhikkhu. Here, Bhikkhu, it occurs to someone thus: There was to me, now it is not to me, I had, now I do not gain, he grieves, laments and beats the breast and comes to bewilderment of mind. Thus there is excitement for external non-presence. - Venerable sir, is there non-excitement for external non-presence. The Blessed One said, there is Bhikkhu. Here, Bhikkhu, it does not occur to someone: There was to me, now it is not to me, I had, now I do not gain, he does not grieve or lament, does not beat the breast and come to bewilderment of mind. Thus there is no excitement for external non-presence. -Venerable sir, is there excitement for internal non-presence: The Blessed One said, there is Bhikkhu. Here, Bhikkhu, to a certain one there is this view. The world, the self, I will be in the future, permanent, not changing, an eternal thing. Then he hears this Teaching from the Thus Gone One or from a disciple of the Thus Gone One for the complete abolishment of views, determinant resolutions, prepossessions, latent tendencies for settlements, for the appeasement of all determinations, for the giving up of all endearments, for the destruction of craving, for non attachment, cessation and extinction.
