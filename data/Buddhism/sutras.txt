Here, monks, a monk dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, observing body in body, having removed craving and aversion towards the world [of mind and matter]; he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, observing sensations in sensations, having removed craving and aversion towards the world [of mind and matter]; he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, observing mind in mind, having removed craving and aversion towards the world [of mind and matter]; he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, observing mental contents in mental contents, having removed craving and aversion towards the world [of mind and matter].
The Observation of Body|2|1| Section on Respiration: And how, monks, does a monk dwell observing body in body? Here a monk, having gone into the forest, or to the foot of a tree, or to an empty room, sits down cross-legged, keeps his body upright and fixes his awareness in the area around the mouth.

If there is birth for all kinds of beings in whatever kind of existence, their conception, their being born, their becoming, the coming into manifestation of their aggregates, the acquisition of their sense faculties - this, monks, is called birth. And what, monks, is old age? If there is old age for all kinds of beings in whatever kind of existence, their getting frail and decrepit, the breaking [of their teeth], their becoming grey and wrinkled, the running down of their life span, the deterioration of their sense faculties - this, monks, is called old age. And what, monks, is death? If there is vanishing and passing away for all kinds of beings in whatever kind of existence, their disintegration, their disappearance, their dying, their death, the completion of their life span, the dissolution of the aggregates, the discarding of the body, the destruction of their vitality - this, monks, is called death. And what, monks, is sorrow? Whenever one, monks, is affected by various kinds of loss and misfortune, that are followed by this or that kind of painful state of mind, by sorrow, by mourning, by sorrowfulness, by inward grief, and by deep inward woe - this, monks, is called sorrow.

Whenever one, monks, is affected by various kinds of loss and misfortune, that are followed by this or that kind of painful state of mind, by wailing and crying, by lamentation, by deep wailing, by deep lamentation, by the state of deep wailing and deep lamentation - this, monks, is called lamentation.

And what, monks, is grief?

And what, monks, is the suffering of being associated with what one does not like? Wherever and whenever one finds unpleasant, disagreeable or disliked objects of sight, sound, smell, taste, touch or of the mind, or, whenever and wherever one finds that there are wishers of one’s own misfortune, harm, difficulties or of one’s own insecurity; if one gets associated, one meets, one comes into contact or gets combined with them - this, monks, is called the suffering of being associated with what one does not like. And what, monks, is the suffering of being disassociated with what one does like? Wherever and whenever one finds pleasant, agreeable or liked objects of sight, sound, smell, taste, touch or of the mind, or, whenever and wherever one finds that there are wishers of one’s own fortune, prosperity, comfort or of one’s own security, like mother and father, like brother and sister, like friends and colleagues or relatives; if one gets disassociated, one does not meet, one does not come into contact or does not get combined with them - this, monks, is called the suffering of being disassociated with what one does like. And what, monks, is not getting what one desires? In beings, monks, who are subject to birth the desire arises: "Oh, truly, that we were not subject to birth! Oh, truly, may there be no new birth for us!" But this cannot be obtained by mere desire; and not to get what one wants is suffering. In beings, monks, who are subject to old age the desire arises: "Oh, truly, that we were not subject to old age! Oh, truly, may we not be subject to old age!" But this cannot be obtained by mere desire; and not to get what one wants is suffering. In beings, monks, who are subject to sickness the desire arises: "Oh, truly, that we were not subject to sickness! Oh, truly, may there be no sickness for us!" But this cannot be obtained by mere desire; and not to get what one wants is suffering. In beings, monks, who are subject to death the desire arises: "Oh, truly, that we were not subject to death! Oh, truly, may we never have to die!" But this cannot be obtained by mere desire; and not to get what one wants is suffering. In beings, monks, who are subject to sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and distress the desire arises: "Oh, truly, that we were not subject to sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and distress! Oh, truly, may we not suffer from sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and distress!" But this cannot be obtained by mere desire; and not to get what one wants is suffering. And how, monks, in short, is clinging to the five aggregates suffering? It is as follows - clinging to the aggregate of matter is suffering, clinging to the aggregate of sensation is suffering, clinging to the aggregate of perception is suffering, clinging to the aggregate of reaction is suffering, clinging to the aggregate of consciousness is suffering. This, monks, in short, is called suffering because of clinging to these five aggregates. This, monks, is the Noble Truth of Suffering.

This, monks, is the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering.
Exposition of the Truth of the Path|9|1| And what, monks, is the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering? It is this, the Noble Eightfold Path, namely: right understanding, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right awareness and right concentration. And what, monks, is Right Understanding? It is this, monks: the knowledge of suffering, the knowledge of the arising of suffering, the knowledge of the cessation of suffering, the knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of suffering. This, monks, is called Right Understanding. And what, monks, is Right Thought? Thoughts of renunciation, thoughts that are free from aversion and thoughts that are free from violence. This, monks, is called Right Thought. And what, monks, is Right Speech? Abstaining from lying, abstaining from slander and backbiting, abstaining from harsh words and abstaining from frivolous talk. This, monks, is called Right Speech. And what, monks, is Right Action? Abstaining from killing, abstaining from taking what has not been given and abstaining from sexual misconduct. This, monks, is called Right Action. And what, monks, is Right Livelihood? Here, monks, a noble disciple having given up wrong ways of livelihood earns his livelihood by right means. This, monks, is called Right Livelihood. And what, monks, is Right Effort? Here, monks, a monk generates the will to prevent the arising of unarisen evil unwholesome mental states; he makes strong effort, stirs up his energy, applies his mind to it and strives. To eradicate those evil unwholesome mental states that have arisen in him, he generates the will, makes strong effort, stirs up his energy, applies his mind to it and strives. To develop wholesome mental states that have not yet arisen in him, he generates will, makes strong effort, stirs up his energy, applies his mind to it and strives. To maintain wholesome mental states that have arisen in him, not to let them fade away, to multiply them and bring them to full maturity and to full development, he generates will, makes strong effort, stirs up his energy, applies his mind to it and strives. This, monks, is called Right Effort. And what, monks, is Right Awareness? Here, monks, a monk dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, observing body in body, having removed craving and aversion towards the world [of mind and matter]; he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, observing sensations in sensations, having removed craving and aversion towards the world [of mind and matter]; he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, observing mind in mind, having removed craving and aversion towards the world [of mind and matter]; he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, observing mental contents in mental contents, having removed craving and aversion towards the world [of mind and matter]. This, monks, is called Right Awareness. And what, monks, is right concentration? Here monks, a monk, detached from craving, detached from unwholesome mental states, enters into the first absorption, born of detachment, accompanied by initial and sustained application of the mind and filled with rapture and bliss and he dwells therein. With the subsiding of initial and sustained application of the mind and gaining inner tranquillity and oneness of mind he enters into the second absorption, born of concentration, free from initial and sustained application of the mind, filled with rapture and bliss and he dwells therein. After the fading away of rapture he dwells in equanimity, aware with constant thorough understanding of impermanence, and he experiences in his body the bliss of which the noble ones say: "That bliss is experienced by one with equanimity and awareness." Thus he enters the third absorption and dwells therein. After the eradication of pleasure and pain and with joy and grief having previously passed away, he enters into a state beyond pleasure and pain, the fourth absorption, that is totally purified by equanimity and awareness and he dwells therein. This, monks, is called Right Concentration. This, monks, is the Noble Truth of the Path leading to the Cessation of Suffering.
Exposition of the Truth of the Path|9|2| Thus he dwells observing mental contents in mental contents internally, or he dwells observing mental contents in mental contents externally, or he dwells observing mental contents in mental contents both internally and externally. Thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of arising in the mental contents, thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of passing away in the mental contents, thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of arising and passing away in the mental contents. Now his awareness is established: "These are mental contents!" Thus he develops his awareness to such an extent that there is mere understanding along with mere awareness. In this way he dwells detached, without clinging towards anything in the world [of mind and matter]. This is how, monks, a monk dwells observing mental contents in mental contents as regards the Four Noble Truths.
The Results of the Establishing of Awareness|10|1| Indeed, monks, whoever practises this fourfold establishing of awareness in this manner for seven years, he may expect one of two results: in this very life highest wisdom or, if a substratum of aggregates remains, the stage of non-returner. Let alone seven years, monks. Should any person practise this fourfold establishing of awareness in this manner for six years, one of two results may be expected in him: in this very life highest wisdom or, if a substratum of aggregates remains, the stage of non-returner. Let alone six years, monks... Let alone five years, monks... Let alone four years, monks... Let alone three years, monks... Let alone two years, monks... Let alone one year, monks. Should any person practise this fourfold establishing of awareness in this manner for seven months, one of two results may be expected in him: in this very life highest wisdom or, if a substratum of aggregates remains, the stage of non-returner. Let alone seven months, monks... Let alone six months, monks... Let alone five months, monks... Let alone four months, monks... Let alone three months, monks... Let alone two months, monks... Let alone one month, monks... Let alone half a month, monks... Let alone half a month, monks. Should any person practise this fourfold establishing of awareness in this manner for seven days, one of two results may be expected in him: in this very life highest wisdom or, if a substratum of aggregates remains, the stage of non-returner. It is for this reason that it was said: "This is the one and only way, monks, for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the extinguishing of suffering and grief, for walking on the path of truth, for the realisation of nibbāna: that is to say, the fourfold establishing of awareness." Thus the Enlightened One spoke. Glad in heart, the monks welcomed the words of the Enlightened One.
A Little Spell of Emptiness|1|1| I hear tell: Once Upon A Time, The Lucky Man, Savatthi-Town, East-Park, The Palace of Migara’s Mother came-a-visiting. At this time, Ananda, just emerging from his afternoon’s sit down practice, went to the Teacher, greeted him, and sat down to one side. There he said: Sir, at one time, The Lucky Man was residing among the Sakyans in the market town of Nagaraka, and I, also, was there. In that place, I recall having heard, learnt, studied, grasped, face-to-face with the Lucky Man, this statement made by him: "At this time, Ananda, I reside in the fullness of emptiness." Did I hear this correctly?
A Little Spell of Emptiness|1|2| Yes, Ananda, you heard, learnt, studied, grasped this correctly. Previously, as well as now, I reside in the fullness of emptiness. In the same way, Ananda, as this Palace of Migara’s Mother [1] is empty of the disturbances of the city: empty of elephants, cows, horses, asses; empty of dealings with gold and silver; empty of groups of men and women, and there is only this that remains to disturb the emptiness: that is, the vibration emanating off the beggars here; in the same way, a beggar, paying no attention to the disturbances of the city, paying no attention to human beings, pays attention only to the vibration emanating off the forest. He takes to paying attention only to perception of the forest, and cleans out, tidies up and liberates his mind.
A Little Spell of Emptiness|1|3| He understands: "This way there is no disturbance emanating from perception of the city. This way there is no disturbance emanating from perception of human beings. This way there is only that disturbance which emanates off perception of the forest." Thus: "This way is empty of disturbance emanating from perception of the city. This way is empty of disturbance emanating from perception of human beings. This way there is only this that disturbs the emptiness: that is, the vibration which emanates off perception of the forest." In this way he regards that which is present as empty of that which is not present; and, with regard to what remains, he understands that: ‘That being; this is.’
A Little Spell of Emptiness|1|4| Thus, Ananda, there is in the case of this case, a sitting-down-to-empty-out that results in surpassing purity. And again, Ananda, deeper than that, paying no attention to human beings, paying no attention to the forest, he takes to paying attention only to perception of earth, and cleans out, tidies up and liberates his mind. In the same way as he would regard a bull’s hide, stretched out to cure, held down by a hundred pegs, it’s life done gone; when he pays attention to earth, he does not think about anything on earth such as dry land or rivers or swamps or marshes with plants with branches and thorns or mountains or plains, but he only just pays attention to the vibration which emanates off perception of earth. He takes to paying attention only to perception of earth, and cleans out, tidies up and liberates his mind.
A Little Spell of Emptiness|1|5| He understands: "This way there is no disturbance emanating from perception of human beings. This way there is no disturbance emanating from perception of the forest." Thus: "This way is empty of disturbance emanating from perception of human beings. This way is empty of disturbance emanating from perception of the forest. This way there is only this that disturbs the emptiness: that is, the vibration which emanates off perception of earth." In this way he regards that which is present as empty of that which is not present; and, with regard to what remains, he understands that: ‘That being; this is.’ Thus, Ananda, there is in the case of this case, a sitting-down-to-empty-out that results in surpassing purity. And again, Ananda, deeper than that, paying no attention to the forest, paying no attention to earth, he takes to paying attention only to perception of The Sphere of Unlimited Space, and cleans out, tidies up and liberates his mind.
A Little Spell of Emptiness|1|6| He understands: "This way there is no disturbance emanating from perception of the forest. This way there is no disturbance emanating from perception of earth." Thus: "This way is empty of disturbance emanating from perception of the forest. This way is empty of disturbance emanating from perception of earth. This way there is only this that disturbs the emptiness: that is, the vibration which emanates off perception of the Sphere of Unlimited Space." In this way he regards that which is present as empty of that which is not present, and, with regard to what remains, he understands that ‘That being, this is.’ Thus, Ananda, there is in the case of this case, a sitting-down-to-empty-out that results in surpassing purity. And again, Ananda, deeper than that, paying no attention to earth, paying no attention to The Sphere of Unlimited Space, he takes to paying attention only to perception of the Sphere of Unlimited Consciousness, and cleans out, tidies up and liberates his mind.
A Little Spell of Emptiness|1|7| He understands: "This way there is no disturbance emanating from perception of earth. This way there is no disturbance emanating from perception of The Sphere of Unlimited Space." Thus: "This way is empty of disturbance emanating from perception of earth. This way is empty of disturbance emanating from perception of The Sphere of Unlimited Space. This way there is only this that disturbs the emptiness: that is, the vibration which emanates off perception of the Sphere of Unlimited Consciousness." In this way he regards that which is present as empty of that which is not present, and, with regard to what remains, he understands that ‘That being, this is.’ Thus, Ananda, there is in the case of this case, a sitting-down-to-empty-out that results in surpassing purity. And again, Ananda, deeper than that, paying no attention to The Sphere of Unlimited Space, paying no attention to The Sphere of Unlimited Consciousness, he takes to paying attention only to perception of The Sphere Where No Thing’s There, and cleans out, tidies up and liberates his mind.
A Little Spell of Emptiness|1|8| He understands: "This way there is no disturbance emanating from perception of The Sphere of Unlimited Space. This way there is no disturbance emanating from the perception of The Sphere of Unlimited Consciousness." Thus: "This way is empty of disturbance emanating from perception of the Sphere of Unlimited Space. This way is empty of disturbance emanating from perception of The Sphere of Unlimited Consciousness. This way there is only this that disturbs the emptiness: that is, the vibration which emanates off perception of the Sphere Where No Thing’s There." In this way he regards that which is present as empty of that which is not present, and, with regard to what remains, he understands that ‘That being, this is.’ Thus, Ananda, there is in the case of this case, a sitting-down-to-empty-out that results in surpassing purity. And again, Ananda, deeper than that, paying no attention to The Sphere of Unlimited Consciousness, paying no attention to The Sphere Where No Thing’s There, he takes to paying attention only to perception of The Sphere of Neither Perception Nor Non Perception, and cleans out, tidies up and liberates his mind.
A Little Spell of Emptiness|1|9| He understands: "This way there is no disturbance emanating from perception of The Sphere of Unlimited Consciousness. This way there is no disturbance emanating from perception of The Sphere Where No Thing’s There." Thus: "This way is empty of disturbance emanating from perception of the Sphere of Unlimited Consciousness. This way is empty of disturbance emanating from the perception of The Sphere Where No Thing’s There. This way there is only this that disturbs the emptiness: that is, the vibration which emanates off perception of the Sphere of Neither Perception Nor Non Perception." In this way he regards that which is present as empty of that which is not present, and, with regard to what remains, he understands that ‘That being, this is.’ Thus, Ananda, there is in the case of this case, a sitting-down-to-empty-out that results in surpassing purity. And again, Ananda, deeper than that, paying no attention to The Sphere Where No Thing’s There, paying no attention to The Sphere of Neither Perception Nor Non Perception, he takes to paying attention only to the mental High-Getting that is Sign-less, and cleans out, tidies up and liberates his mind.
A Little Spell of Emptiness|1|10| He understands: "This way there is no disturbance emanating from perception of The Sphere Where No Thing’s There. This way there is no disturbance emanating from perception of the Sphere of Neither Perception Nor Non Perception." Thus: "This way is empty of disturbance emanating from perception of The Sphere Where No Thing’s There. This way is empty of disturbance emanating from perception of The Sphere of Neither Perception Nor Non Perception. This way there is only this that disturbs the emptiness: that is, the six sense-realms bound to this body reacting to life." In this way he regards that which is present as empty of that which is not present, and, with regard to what remains, he understands that ‘That being, this is.’ Thus, Ananda, there is in the case of this case, a sitting-down-to-empty-out that results in surpassing purity. And again, Ananda, deeper than that, paying no attention to The Sphere Where No Thing’s There, paying no attention to The Sphere of Neither Perception Nor Non Perception, he takes to paying attention only to the mental High-Getting that is Sign-less, and cleans out, tidies up and liberates his mind. He understands: "This Mental High-Getting that is Sign-less is something that has been constructed, thought out. Whatever has been constructed or thought out is subject to change and coming to an end." Knowing and seeing this, his heart is free from the grip of sense pleasures, his heart is freed from the grip of living, his mind is free from the grip of blindness. In Freedom comes the knowledge of Freedom, and he knows: "Left Behind is Rebirth, Lived is the Best of Lives, Done is Duty’s Doing, Crossed over Am I; No More It’n and At’n for Me!"
A Little Spell of Emptiness|1|11| He understands: "This way there is no disturbance emanating from the grip of sense pleasures. This way there is no disturbance emanating from the grip of living. This way there is no disturbance emanating from the grip of blindness." Thus: "This way is empty of the disturbance emanating from the grip of sense pleasures. This way is empty of the disturbance emanating from the grip of living. This way is empty of the disturbance emanating from the grip of blindness. This way there is only this that disturbs the emptiness, that is the six sense-realms bound to this body reacting to life." In this way he regards that which is present as empty of that which is not present, and, with regard to what remains, he understands that ‘That being, this is.’ Thus, Ananda, there is in the case of this case, a sitting-down-to-empty-out that results in surpassing purity. And, Ananda, all those Shamen or Brahmen of the long distant past who attained the highest surpassing purity of emptiness and made it a habitat, all of them did so by attaining this same highest surpassing purity of emptiness and making it a habitat. And, Ananda, all those Shamen or Brahmen who in the far distant future will attain the highest surpassing purity of emptiness and make it a habitat, all of them will do so by attaining this same highest surpassing purity of emptiness and making it a habitat. And, Ananda, all those Shamen or Brahmen who at present are able to attain the highest surpassing purity of emptiness and make it a habitat, all of them do so by attaining this same highest surpassing purity of emptiness and making it a habitat. Wherefore, Ananda, train yourself this way: "I will attain the highest surpassing purity of emptiness and make a habitat of that."

The Discourse On In and Out Breathing|1|1| I heard thus: At one time the Blessed One lived in the Pubba monastery in the palace of Migaara’s mother, with the thoroughly learned elder disciples, such as Venerable’s Shariputra, Maha Moggallana, Maha Kassapa, Maha Kaccana, Maha Kotthita, Maha Kappina, Maha Cunda, Anuruddha, Revata, Ananda and other learned elder disciples. At that time the elder Bhikkhus were advising and instructing the novices. A certain elder Bhikkhu advised ten novices, another twenty novices, another thirty and yet another forty novices. The novices too advised and instructed by the elder Bhikkhus attained distinctive levels not attained before. On that full moon night the Blessed One was seated outside in the moonlight attended by the Community of Bhikkhus 
The Discourse On In and Out Breathing|1|2| The Blessed One observed the silent Community of Bhikkhus and addressed them ‘Bhikkhus, I’m happy and convinced with this mode of progress. Therefore Bhikkhus arouse much effort to attain the not attained, to realize the not realized, as I would be leaving Savatthi on the full moon day of the fourth month of the rains.’ The Bhikkhus who had come from the states heard these words and they came to see the Blessed One. The elder Bhikkhus hearing these words were very pleased and advised and instructed the novices. A certain elder Bhikkhu advised ten novices, another twenty novices, another thirty and yet another forty novices. The novices too advised and instructed by the elder Bhikkhus attained distinctive levels not attained before. On that full moon night of the fourth month of the rains the Blessed One was seated outside, in the moonlight attended by the Community of Bhikkhus 
The Discourse On In and Out Breathing|1|3| Then the Blessed One observed the silent Community of Bhikkhus and addressed them. Bhikkhus, this gathering is without idle talk, without empty talk, established in the pure essence. Such a gathering is worthy of honor, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings and reverential salutation, and it becomes an incomparable field of merit to the worldling. Giving a little to such a gathering brings many results, giving much brings much more. The sight of such a gathering is rare in the world.

In this gathering there are worthy ones, desires destroyed, lived the holy life, done what should be done, dismissed the weight, come to the highest good, destroyed the bond ‘to be’ and rightly knowing released. In this gathering there are Bhikkhus who have destroyed the five lower bonds of the sensual world and are born spontaneously, not to proceed but to extinguish in that same birth.

When the four establishments of mindfulness are developed and made much the seven enlightenment factors get completed. When the seven enlightenment factors are developed and made much the knowledge of release gets completed. Bhikkhus, how is, in and out breathing developed and made much? 
The Discourse On In and Out Breathing|1|5| How does it bring much results and great results? The Bhikkhu, gone to the forest, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty house, sits legs crossed, the body straight, and mindfulness established in front. Mindfully he breathes in or breathes out.

The Discourse On In and Out Breathing|1|6| Bhikkhus, in and out breathing developed and made much in which manner, do the four establishments of mindfulness get completed? Bhikkhus, when the Bhikkhu breathing in long knows, I breathe in long. Breathing out long knows, I breathe out long. Breathing in short knows, I breathe in short. Breathing out short knows, I breathe out short. Trains, calming the bodily determination, I breathe in and out, at such times he reflects the body in the body. At such times he is zealous to be mindful and aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure for the world. Bhikkhus, I say in breaths and out breaths are a special feature in the body. Therefore Bhikkhus, at such times, the Bhikkhu abides reflecting the body in the body zealous to be mindful and aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure for the world. Bhikkhus, when the Bhikkhu trains experiencing joy I breathe in and out Trains experiencing pleasantness I breathe in and out. Trains experiencing the mental determination I breathe in and out.

Trains, reflecting cessation. I breathe in and out. Trains, reflecting giving up. I breathe in and out, at such times he reflects thoughts in the Teaching.

He wisely attends to the dispelling of whatever covetousness and displeasure in the world and masters it. Therefore Bhikkhus, at such times, the Bhikkhu abides reflecting thoughts in the Teaching, zealous to be mindful and aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure for the world. Bhikkhus, when developed and made much in this manner the four foundations of mindfulness get completed.
The Discourse On In and Out Breathing|1|8| The four establishments of mindfulness developed and made much in which manner, do the seven enlightenment factors get completed? Bhikkhus, at the time the Bhikkhu abides reflecting the body in the body mindful and aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure for the world, his mindfulness is established without forgetfulness. At a time the Bhikkhus mindfulness is established, the enlightenment factor mindfulness is established to the Bhikkhu, at that time the Bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor mindfulness and completes it. He abides with those thoughts mindfully examining them, wisely searching for the solution...Bhikkhus, at a time the Bhikkhu abides thus, mindfully examining the Teaching wisely, to search for the solution, he develops the enlightenment factor the investigation of the Teaching, and completes it. When those thoughts are wisely examined for a direct solution with aroused effort the enlightenment factor effort, is established to the Bhikkhu, at that time the Bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor effort and completes it. With the aroused effort arises immaterial joy. When immaterial joy arises the Bhikkhu is established in the enlightenment factor joy and it gets completed. When the mind is joyful the body is appeased, so too the mind. When the mind and body are appeased, the enlightenment factor appeasement gets established in the Bhikkhu, with development it gets completed.

The Bhikkhu thoroughly examines the concentrated mind. At that time the Bhikkhu is established in the enlightenment factor equanimity, with development it gets completed.

Suitability to Attain Imperturbability|1|1| I heard thus: At one time the Blessed One was living in the Kuru country, in the hamlet named Kammassadhamma. The Blessed One addressed the Bhikkhus from there. 'Bhikkhus, sensuality is impermanent, useless, false, a stupid thing and a deception. It is prattle and foolish talk. Sensuality here and now and hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, all these are the domain of death, the pasture of death. The evil mind with sensuality is led to greed, anger and quarrels Bhikkhus the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality is impermanent, useless, false, a stupid thing and a deception. It is prattle and foolish talk. Sensuality here and now and hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, all these are the domain of death, the pasture of death. The evil mind with sensuality is led to greed, anger and quarrels. What if I develop the mind grown great and much, above the material world, then there will be no greed, anger, or quarrels. When these are dispelled my mind will be significant, limitless and well developed. Fallen to this method, when developed much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere or abides in imperturbability here and now, or with wisdom it is released. After death, there is a possibility that the led on, consciousness should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, I say, this is the first suitability to reach imperturbability.
Suitability to Attain Imperturbability|1|2| Again Bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now and hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever matter of the four primary elements, is on account of this held on matter. Fallen to this method, when developed much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere or abides in imperturbability here and now, or with wisdom it is released. After death, there is a possibility that the led on, consciousness should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, I say, this is the second suitability to reach imperturbability.
Suitability to Attain Imperturbability|1|3| Again Bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now and hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever matter, here and now or hereafter, whatever material perceptions here and now and here after, all these are impermanent. It is not suitable to take pleasure and appropriate what is impermanent. Fallen to this method, when developed much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere or abides in imperturbability here and now, or with wisdom it is released. After death, there is a possibility that this led on, consciousness should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, this is the third suitability to reach imperturbability, I say.
Suitability to Attain Imperturbability|1|4| Again Bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now and hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever matter, here and now or hereafter, whatever material perceptions here and now and here after and the perception of imperturbability, all these perceptions cease in this sphere of nothingness, without a remainder. It is peaceful and exalted. Fallen to this method, when developed much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere or abides in imperturbability here and now, or with wisdom it is released. After death, there is a possibility that this led on, consciousness should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, I say, this is the first suitability to reach the sphere of nothingness.
Suitability to Attain Imperturbability|1|5| Again, Bhikkhus, the noble disciple gone to the forest or to the root of a tree reflects. All these are perceived things, of the self, or of the belongings of the self. Fallen to this method, when developed much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere or abides in imperturbability here and now, or with wisdom it is released. After death, there is a possibility that this led on consciousness should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, I say, this is the second suitability to reach the sphere of nothingness. Again, Bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects, I have no greed, hate or delusion for anybody, neither is there greed, hate and delusion to me from anyone. Fallen to this method, when developed much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere or abides in imperturbability here and now, or with wisdom it is released. After death, there is a possibility that this led on consciousness should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, I say, this is the third suitability to reach the sphere of nothingness.
Suitability to Attain Imperturbability|1|6| Again Ananda, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now and hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever matter, here and now or hereafter, whatever material perceptions here and now and here after, the perception of imperturbability and the perception of nothingness, all these perceptions cease in this sphere of neither perception nor non-perception, without a remainder. It is peaceful and exalted. Fallen to this method, when developed much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere or abides in neither perception nor non perception here and now, or with wisdom it is released. After death, there is a possibility that this led on, consciousness should reach the sphere of neither perception nor non perception. Bhikkhus, I say, this is suitability to reach the sphere of neither perception nor non perception.'
Suitability to Attain Imperturbability|1|7| Then venerable Ananda said. 'Venerable sir, the Bhikkhu falls to this method, there is not, there is not to me, there will not be, there will not be to me, whatever there is, whatever produced, I discard, thus he gains equanimity. Venerable sir, is that Bhikkhu extinguished?' 'Ananda, a certain Bhikkhu fallen to this method may extinguish, another would not.' 'Venerable sir, why should a certain Bhikkhu fallen to this method extinguish and another not extinguish?' 'Ananda, the Bhikkhu falls to this method, there is not, there is not to me, there will not be, there will not be to me, whatever there is, whatever produced, I discard, thus he gains equanimity. He delights in that equanimity, welcomes it, tied to it, his consciousness settles in it. Ananda, the Bhikkhu with settlements does not extinguish.'
Suitability to Attain Imperturbability|1|8| 'Venerable sir, where does the Bhikkhu settle?' 'Ananda, in neither-perception-nor-non-perception.' 'Venerable sir, he settles in the highest settlement.' 'Ananda, of settlements neither-perception-nor non-perception, is the highest settlement Ananda, the Bhikkhu falls to this method, there is not, there is not to me, there will not be, there will not be to me, whatever there is, whatever produced, I discard, thus he gains equanimity. He does not delight in that equanimity, does not welcome it, not tied to it his consciousness does not settle in it. Ananda, the Bhikkhu without settlements is extinguished.' 'Wonderful, venerable sir, the Blessed One has explained the crossing of the flood supported on higher and higher spheres. Venerable sir, how is noble release?'
Suitability to Attain Imperturbability|1|9| 'Again Ananda, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now and hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever matter, here and now or hereafter, whatever material perceptions here and now and here after, the perception of imperturbability, the perception of nothingness, and the sphere of neither perception nor non perception, these are things of the self and are holdings, that mind without holdings is the mind's release. Ananda, I have taught you the method to attain, imperturbability, the sphere of nothingness, the sphere of neither perception-nor-non-perception, the method of crossing the flood supported on higher and higher spheres and the noble release. Whatever a teacher should do to his disciples out of compassion, that I have done to you. Ananda, these are the roots of trees, and these are the empty houses. Ananda, concentrate and do not have remorse later. This is our advice to you. The Blessed One said those words and those Bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One.
What Was Not Said|1|1| "Monks, these two slander the Tathágata. Which two? He who explains what was not said or spoken by the Tathágata as said or spoken by the Tathágata and he who explains what was said or spoken by the Tathágata as not said or spoken by the Tathágata. These are two who slander the Tathágata."
To Prince Abhaya|1|1| I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. Then Prince Abhaya went to Nigantha Nataputta and on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, Nigantha Nataputta said to him, "Come, now, prince. Refute the words of the contemplative Gotama, and this admirable report about you will spread afar: 'The words of the contemplative Gotama -- so mighty, so powerful -- were refuted by Prince Abhaya!'"
To Prince Abhaya|1|2| "But how, venerable sir, will I refute the words of the contemplative Gotama -- so mighty, so powerful?" "Come now, prince. Go to the contemplative Gotama and on arrival say this: 'Venerable sir, would the Tathágata say words that are un-endearing and disagreeable to others?' If the contemplative Gotama, thus asked, answers, 'The Tathágata would say words that are un-endearing and disagreeable to others,' then you should say, 'Then how is there any difference between you, venerable sir, and run-of-the-mill people? For even run-of-the-mill people say words that are un-endearing and disagreeable to others.' But if the contemplative Gotama, thus asked, answers, 'The Tathágata would not say words that are un-endearing and disagreeable to others,' then you should say, 'Then how, venerable sir, did you say of Devadatta that "Devadatta is headed for destitution, Devadatta is headed for hell, Devadatta will boil for an eon, Devadatta is incurable"? 
To Prince Abhaya|1|3| For Devadatta was upset and disgruntled at those words of yours.' When the contemplative Gotama is asked this two-pronged question by you, he won't be able to swallow it down or spit it up. Just as if a two-horned chestnut [1] were stuck in a man's throat: he would not be able to swallow it down or spit it up. In the same way, when the contemplative Gotama is asked this two-pronged question by you, he won't be able to swallow it down or spit it up."
To Prince Abhaya|1|4| Responding, "As you say, venerable sir," Prince Abhaya got up from his seat, bowed down to Nigantha Nataputta, circumambulated him, and then went to the Blessed One. On arrival, he bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he glanced up at the sun and thought, "Today is not the time to refute the Blessed One's words. Tomorrow in my own home I will overturn the Blessed One's words." So he said to the Blessed One, "May the Blessed One, together with three others, acquiesce to my offer of tomorrow's meal."
To Prince Abhaya|1|5| The Blessed One acquiesced with silence. Then Prince Abhaya, understanding the Blessed One's acquiescence, got up from his seat, bowed down to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and left. Then, after the night had passed, the Blessed One early in the morning put on his robes and, carrying his bowl and outer robe, went to Prince Abhaya's home. On arrival, he sat down on a seat made ready. Prince Abhaya, with his own hand, served and satisfied the Blessed One with fine staple and non-staple foods. Then, when the Blessed One had eaten and had removed his hand from his bowl, Prince Abhaya took a lower seat and sat down to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, "Venerable sir, would the Tathágata say words that are un-endearing and disagreeable to others?" "Prince, there is no categorical yes-or-no answer to that." "Then right here, venerable sir, the Niganthas are destroyed." "But prince, why do you say, 'then right here, venerable sir, the Niganthas are destroyed'?" "Just yesterday, venerable sir, I went to Nigantha Nataputta and... he said to me...'Come now, prince. Go to the contemplative Gotama and on arrival say this: "Venerable sir, would the Tathágata say words that are un-endearing and disagreeable to others?"... Just as if a two-horned chestnut were stuck in a man's throat: he would not be able to swallow it down or spit it up. In the same way, when the contemplative Gotama is asked this two-pronged question by you, he won't be able to swallow it down or spit it up.'"
To Prince Abhaya|1|6| Now at that time a baby boy was lying face-up on the prince's lap. So the Blessed One said to the prince, "What do you think, prince: If this young boy, through your own negligence or that of the nurse, were to take a stick or a piece of gravel into its mouth, what would you do?" "I would take it out, venerable sir. If I couldn't get it out right away, then holding its head in my left hand and crooking a finger of my right, I would take it out, even if it meant drawing blood. Why is that? Because I have sympathy for the young boy." "In the same way, prince: [1] In the case of words that the Tathágata knows to be un-factual, untrue, unbeneficial (or: not connected with the goal), un-endearing and disagreeable to others, he does not say them. [2] In the case of words that the Tathágata knows to be factual, true, unbeneficial, un-endearing and disagreeable to others, he does not say them. [3] In the case of words that the Tathágata knows to be factual, true, beneficial, but un-endearing and disagreeable to others, he has a sense of the proper time for saying them. [4] In the case of words that the Tathágata knows to be un-factual, untrue, unbeneficial, but endearing and agreeable to others, he does not say them. [5] In the case of words that the Tathágata knows to be factual, true, unbeneficial, but endearing and agreeable to others, he does not say them. [6] In the case of words that the Tathágata knows to be factual, true, beneficial, and endearing and agreeable to others, he has a sense of the proper time for saying them. Why is that? Because the Tathágata has sympathy for living beings."
To Prince Abhaya|1|7| "Venerable sir, when wise nobles or priests, householders or contemplatives, having formulated questions, come to the Tathágata and ask him, does this line of reasoning appear to his awareness beforehand -- 'If those who approach me ask this, I -- thus asked -- will answer in this way' -- or does the Tathágata come up with the answer on the spot?" "In that case, prince, I will ask you a counter-question. Answer as you see fit. What do you think: are you skilled in the parts of a chariot?" "Yes, venerable sir. I am skilled in the parts of a chariot." "And what do you think: When people come and ask you, 'What is the name of this part of the chariot?' does this line of reasoning appear to your awareness beforehand -- 'If those who approach me ask this, I -- thus asked -- will answer in this way' -- or do you come up with the answer on the spot?" "Venerable sir, I am renowned for being skilled in the parts of a chariot. All the parts of a chariot are well-known to me. I come up with the answer on the spot." "In the same way, prince, when wise nobles or priests, householders or contemplatives, having formulated questions, come to the Tathágata and ask him, he comes up with the answer on the spot. Why is that, because the property of the Dhamma is thoroughly penetrated by the Tathágata. From his thorough penetration of the property of the Dhamma, he comes up with the answer on the spot." When this was said, Prince Abhaya said to the Blessed One: "Magnificent, venerable sir! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One -- through many lines of reasoning -- made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of monks. May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life."
Fearless|1|1| Then Janussoni the Brahman went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "I am of the view and opinion that there is no one who, subject to death, is not afraid or in terror of death."
Fearless|1|2| The Blessed One said: "Brahman, there are those who, subject to death, are afraid and in terror of death. And there are those who, subject to death, are not afraid or in terror of death. "And who is the person who, subject to death, is afraid and in terror of death? There is the case of the person who has not abandoned passion, desire, fondness, thirst, fever, and craving for sensuality. Then he comes down with a serious disease. As he comes down with a serious disease, the thought occurs to him, 'O, those beloved sensual pleasures will be taken from me, and I will be taken from them!' He grieves and is tormented, weeps, beats his breast, and grows delirious. This is a person who, subject to death, is afraid and in terror of death.
Fearless|1|3| "Furthermore, there is the case of the person who has not abandoned passion, desire, fondness, thirst, fever, and craving for the body. Then he comes down with a serious disease. As he comes down with a serious disease, the thought occurs to him, 'O, my beloved body will be taken from me, and I will be taken from my body!' He grieves and is tormented, weeps, beats his breast, and grows delirious. This, too, is a person who, subject to death, is afraid and in terror of death.
Fearless|1|4| "Furthermore, there is the case of the person who has not done what is good, has not done what is skillful, has not given protection to those in fear, and instead has done what is evil, savage, and cruel. Then he comes down with a serious disease. As he comes down with a serious disease, the thought occurs to him, 'I have not done what is good, have not done what is skillful, have not given protection to those in fear, and instead have done what is evil, savage, and cruel. To the extent that there is a destination for those who have not done what is good, have not done what is skillful, have not given protection to those in fear, and instead have done what is evil, savage, and cruel, that's where I'm headed after death.' He grieves and is tormented, weeps, beats his breast, and grows delirious. This, too, is a person who, subject to death, is afraid and in terror of death.
Fearless|1|5| "Furthermore, there is the case of the person in doubt and perplexity, who has not arrived at certainty with regard to the True Dhamma. Then he comes down with a serious disease. As he comes down with a serious disease, the thought occurs to him, 'How doubtful and perplexed I am! I have not arrived at any certainty with regard to the True Dhamma!' He grieves and is tormented, weeps, beats his breast, and grows delirious. This, too, is a person who, subject to death, is afraid and in terror of death. "These, Brahman, are four people who, subject to death, are afraid and in terror of death. "And who is the person who, subject to death, is not afraid or in terror of death? "There is the case of the person who has abandoned passion, desire, fondness, thirst, fever, and craving for sensuality. Then he comes down with a serious disease. As he comes down with a serious disease, the thought does not occur to him, 'O, those beloved sensual pleasures will be taken from me, and I will be taken from them!' He does not grieve, is not tormented; does not weep, beat his breast, or grow delirious. This is a person who, subject to death, is not afraid or in terror of death.

"These, Brahman, are four people who, subject to death, are not afraid or in terror of death." When this was said, Janussoni the Brahman said to the Blessed One: "Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent!

I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life."
To the King’s Son Abhaya|1|1| I heard thus: At One time the Blessed One was living in the squirrels’ sanctuary in the bamboo grove in Rajagaha. Then the king’s son Abhaya approached Niganthanataputta worshipped and sat on a side. Niganthanataputta said to the king’s son: ‘"Come! Prince, arouse a dispute with the recluse Gotama. When you argue with a person like the recluse Gotama, so powerful and so majestic, your fame will spread." "Venerable sir, how could I arouse a dispute with the recluse Gotama, so powerful and so majestic?" "Come prince, approach the recluse Gotama and ask. Venerable sir, does the Thus Gone One say, such words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others?" When asked thus if, the recluse Gotama replies. "Yes, prince, the Thus Gone One, says words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others." Then you should say. "Venerable sir, what is the difference between you and the ordinary one? The ordinary one says words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others." If he says, "Prince, the Thus Gone One does not say words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others." Then you should say. 
To the King’s Son Abhaya|1|2| "Venerable sir, why did you say these words to Devadatta? Devadatta is in loss, in hell in much difficulty, till the end of the world cycle? On account of those words Devadatta was displeased." When this forked question, is asked, he would not be able to swallow it or spit it out. A man with an iron ring stuck in the throat would not be able to swallow or spit it out. To the King’s Son Abhaya|1|2| In the same manner when this forked question is asked, he would not be able to swallow it or spit it out.’ Prince Abhaya agreed with the words of Niganthanataputta, got up from his seat, worshipped, circumambulated Niganthanataputta and approached the Blessed One. Worshipping the Blessed One he sat on a side. The prince considered the time, and thought it is not the proper time to arouse a dispute with the Blessed One. He thought, I will invite the Blessed One for tomorrow’s meal and arouse the dispute at home. He said. ‘May the Blessed One, accept tomorrow’s meal with three others.’ The Blessed One accepted in silence and the prince knowing that the Blessed One had accepted the invitation, got up from his seat worshipped, circumambulated the Blessed One and went away. The Blessed One at the end of that night, putting on robes in the morning, taking bowl and robes approached the dwelling of the prince, and sat on the prepared seat. Prince Abhaya with his own hands served the nourishing eatables and drinks, and after the meal was over, took a low seat and sat on a side
To the Kings Son Abhaya|1|3| Prince Abhaya then, said to the Blessed. ‘One, Venerable sir, does the Thus Gone One say words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others?’ ‘Prince, in certain respects I do not’ ‘Venerable sir we heard this from the nigantas’. ‘Prince, why do you say, we heard this from the nigantas?’ ‘Here venerable sir, I approached Niganthanaataputta worshipped him and sat on a side. Then Niganthanaataputta said to me. Come prince, approach the recluse Gotama and ask. Venerable sir, does the Thus Gone One say, words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others? When asked thus if the recluse Gotama replies. The Thus Gone One says words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others. Then you say. If that is so venerable sir, what is the difference between you and the ordinary one? The ordinary one says words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others. If he says, Prince, the Thus Gone One does not say words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others. Ask him, venerable sir, why did you say these words to Devadatta? Devadatta is in loss, in hell, in much difficulty till the end of the world cycle. On account of those words Devadatta was displeased. When this forked question is asked, he would not be able to swallow it or spit it out. Like a man with an iron ring stuck in the throat would not be able to swallow or spit it out. In the same manner when this forked question is asked, he would not be able to swallow it or spit it out’.
To the Kings Son Abhaya|1|4| At that time a baby boy, a toddler was seated on the lap of prince Abhaya, the Blessed One said, ‘Prince, on account of some negligence of yours or the nurse, if this baby swallows a piece of stick or a stone, what would you do?’ ‘Venerable sir, I will pull it out. If I could not take it out quickly, taking hold of the head with the left hand, would pull it out with the finger of the right hand, even while blood is spilt. What is the reason? Venerable sir, there is my compassion for the baby’. ‘Prince, in the same manner, when the Thus Gone One knows that words are not true, not conductive to good, and are disagreeable and distasteful to others, the Thus Gone One does not say those words. When the Thus Gone One knows that words are not true, not conductive to good, disagreeable and distasteful to others, the Thus Gone One does not say those words. When the Thus Gone One knows that the words are true, are conductive to good, disagreeable and distasteful to others, the Thus Gone One waits for the right time to explain those words. When the Thus Gone one knows that the words are true, conductive to good, agreeable and tasteful to others, the Thus Gone One does not say those words. When the Thus Gone One knows that the words are true, not conductive to good, agreeable and tasteful to others, the Thus one does not say those words. When the Thus Gone One knows that the words are true conductive to good, agreeable and tasteful to others the Thus Gone One waits for the right time to explain those words. What is the reason: Prince there is compassion for beings in the Thus Gone One’.
To the Kings Son Abhaya|1|5| ‘Venerable sir, wise men, warriors, or Brahmins, or householders, or recluses concoct a question, approach the Thus Gone One and question him. Venerable sir, does the Blessed One, know before hand, they would approach me and ask these questions? Does it occur to the Thus Gone One, when asked thus I will reply thus? Or does the reply at that moment occur to the Thus Gone One?’ ‘Then prince, I will ask a question from you on this, you may reply, as it pleases you. Prince, are you clever about the large and small parts of a chariot?’ ‘Yes, venerable sir, I’m clever in the large and small parts of a chariot.’ ‘Prince, if someone approaches you and asks, about the large and small parts of the chariot, would you before hand know these people will approach me and ask about these parts of the chariot, and when asked this and other thing I will reply thus and thus?’ ‘Venerable sir, I’m a charioteer and I’m clever in the large and small parts of the chariot. When asked the reply occurs to me that moment.’ ‘Prince, in the same manner, these wiseman, warriors, Brahmins, householders, and recluses concoct a question and approach the Thus Gone One, and question him. The answer occurs to the Thus Gone One instantly. What is the reason?: The element of the Teaching is thoroughly known to the Thus Gone One. So the reply to the question occurs to the Thus Gone One that moment.’
To the Kings Son Abhaya|1|6| When this was said, prince Abhaya said thus to the Blessed One. ‘Now I understand it, venerable sir. It is as though something over turned is reinstated. Something covered is made manifest. As though the path was told to someone who had lost his way. It is like an oil lamp lighted in the dark, for those who have sight to see forms. In various ways the Blessed One has explained the Teaching. Now I take refuge in the Blessed One, in the Teaching and the Community of Bhikkhus. May I be remembered as a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today until life ends.’

Urgent|1|1| "There are these three urgent duties of a farming householder. Which three? "There is the case where a farming householder quickly gets his field well-plowed and well-harrowed. Having quickly gotten his field well plowed and well harrowed, he quickly plants the seed. Having quickly planted the seed, he quickly lets in the water and then lets it out. "These are the three urgent duties of a farming householder. Now, that farming householder does not have the power or might to say: 'May my crops spring up today, may the grains appear tomorrow, and may they ripen the next day.' But when the time has come, the farming householder's crops spring up, the grains appear, and they ripen.
Urgent|1|2| "In the same way, there are these three urgent duties of a monk. Which three? The undertaking of heightened virtue, the undertaking of heightened mind, the undertaking of heightened discernment. These are the three urgent duties of a monk. Now, that monk does not have the power or might to say: 'May my mind be released from fermentations through lack of clinging/sustenance today or tomorrow or the next day.' But when the time has come, his mind is released from fermentations through lack of clinging/sustenance. "Thus, monks, you should train yourselves: 'Strong will be our desire for the undertaking of heightened virtue. Strong will be our desire for the undertaking of heightened mind. Strong will be our desire for the undertaking of heightened discernment.' That's how you should train yourselves."
Wonderful And Marvelous|1|1| Thus have I heard: On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. Now a number of Bhikkhus were sitting in the assembly hall, where they had met together on returning from their alms-round, after their meal, when this discussion arose among them: "It is wonderful, friends, it is marvelous, how mighty and powerful is the Tathágata! For he is able to know about the Buddhas of the past—who attained to final Nibbána, cut the tangle of proliferation, broke the cycle, ended the round, and surmounted all suffering—that for those Blessed Ones their birth was thus, their names were thus, their clans were thus, their virtue was thus, their state of concentration was thus, their wisdom was thus, their abiding in attainments was thus, their deliverance was thus."
Wonderful And Marvelous|1|2| When this was said, the venerable Ananda told the Bhikkhus: "Friends, Tathágatas are wonderful and have superb qualities. Tathágatas are marvelous and have splendid qualities." However, their discussion was interrupted; for the Blessed One rose from meditation when it was evening, went to the assembly hall, and sat down on a seat made ready. Then he addressed the Bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus, for what discussion are you sitting together here now? And what was your discussion that was interrupted?" "Here, Venerable Sir, we were sitting in the assembly hall, where we had met together on returning from our alms-round, after our meal, when this discussion arose among us: ‘It is wonderful, friends, it is marvelous…their deliverance was thus." When this was said, Venerable Sir, the Venerable Ananda said to us: ‘Friends, Tathágatas are wonderful and have superb qualities. Tathágatas are marvelous and have splendid qualities.’ This was our discussion, Venerable Sir, that was interrupted when the Blessed One arrived." Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda: "That being so, Ananda, explain more fully the Tathágatas wonderful and marvelous qualities."
Wonderful And Marvelous|1|3| "I heard and learned this, Venerable Sir, from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘Mindful and fully aware, Ananda, the Bodhisattva appeared in the Tushita heaven.’ That mindful and fully aware the Bodhisattva appeared in the Tushita Heaven – This I remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One. ‘I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: Mindful and fully aware the Bodhisattva remained in the Tushita Heaven.’ This too I remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One. "I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘For the whole of his life-span the Bodhisattva remained in the Tushita heaven.’ This too I remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One. 
Wonderful And Marvelous|1|4| "I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘Mindful and fully aware the Bodhisattva passed away from the Tushita heaven and descended into his mother’s womb.’ This too I remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.
Wonderful And Marvelous|1|5| "I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When the Bodhisattva passed away from the Tushita heaven and descended into his mother’s womb, then a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendor of the gods appeared in the world with its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas, in this generation with its recluses and Brahmans, with its princes and its people. And even in those abysmal world interspaces of vacancy, gloom, and utter darkness, where the moon and the sun, mighty and powerful as they are, cannot make the their light prevail—there too a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendor of the gods appeared. And the beings born there perceived each other by that light: "So other beings, indeed, have appeared here." And this ten-thousand-fold world system shook and quaked and trembled, and there too a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendor of the gods appeared.’ This too I remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.
Wonderful And Marvelous|1|6| "I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When the Bodhisattva had descended into his mother’s womb, four young deities came to guard him at the four quarters so that no humans or non-humans or anyone at all could harm the Bodhisattva or his mother.’ This too I remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.
Wonderful And Marvelous|1|7| "I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When the Bodhisattva had descended into his mother’s womb, she became intrinsically virtuous, refraining from killing living beings, from taking what is not given, from misconduct in sensual pleasures, from false speech, and from wines, liquors, and intoxicants, which are the basis of negligence.’ This too I remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.
Wonderful And Marvelous|1|8| "I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When the Bodhisattva had descended into his mother’s womb, no sensual thought arose in her concerning men, and she was inaccessible to any man having a lustful mind.’ This too I remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.
Wonderful And Marvelous|1|9| "I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When the Bodhisattva had descended into his mother’s womb, she obtained the five cords of sensual pleasure, and furnished and endowed with them, she enjoyed herself with them.’ This too I remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.
Wonderful And Marvelous|1|9| "I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘when the Bodhisattva had descended into his mother’s womb, no kind of affliction arose in her; she was blissful and free from bodily fatigue. She saw the Bodhisattva within her womb with all his limbs, lacking no faculty. Suppose a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread were strung through a fine beryl gem of purest water, eight-faceted, well cut, and a man with good sight were to take it in his hand and review it thus: "This is a fine beryl gem of purest water, eight-faceted, well cut, and through it is strung a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread;" so too when the Bodhisattva had descended into his mother’s womb…she saw the Bodhisattva within her womb with all his limbs, lacking no faculty.’ This too I remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.
Wonderful And Marvelous|1|10| "I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘Seven days after the birth of the Bodhisattva, his mother died and reappeared in the Tushita heaven.’ This too I remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.
Wonderful And Marvelous|1|11| "I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘other women give birth after carrying the child in the womb for nine or ten months, but not so the Bodhisattvas mother. The Bodhisattvas mother gave birth after carrying him in her womb for exactly ten months.’ This too I remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.
Wonderful And Marvelous|1|12| "I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘other women give birth seated or lying down, but not so the Bodhisattvas mother. The Bodhisattvas mother gave birth to him standing up.’ This too I remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.
Wonderful And Marvelous|1|13| "I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When the Bodhisattva came forth from his mother’s womb, first gods received him, then human beings. This too I remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.
Wonderful And Marvelous|1|14| "I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: When the Bodhisattva came forth from his mothers womb, he did not touch the earth. The four young gods received him and set him before his mother saying: "Rejoice, oh Queen, a son of great power has been born to you." This too I remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.
Wonderful And Marvelous|1|15| "I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When the Bodhisattva came forth from his mother’s womb, he came forth unsullied, un-smeared by water or humors or blood or any kind of impurity, clean and unsullied. Suppose there were a gem placed on Kasi cloth, then the gem would not smear the cloth or the cloth the gem. Why is that, because of the purity of both! So too when the Bodhisattva came forth…clean and unsullied.’ This too I remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.
Wonderful And Marvelous|1|16| "I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When the Bodhisattva came forth from his mother’s womb, two jets of water appeared to pour from the sky, one cool and one warm, for bathing the Bodhisattva and his mother.’ This too I remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.
Wonderful And Marvelous|1|17| "I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: "As soon as the Bodhisattva was born, he stood firmly with his feet on the ground; then he took seven steps north, and with a white parasol held over him, he surveyed each quarter and uttered the words of the Leader of the Herd: "I am the highest in the world; I am the best in the world; I am the foremost in the world. This is my last birth; now there is no renewal of being for me. This too I remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.
Wonderful And Marvelous|1|18| "I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When the Bodhisattva came forth from his mother’s womb, then a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendor of the gods appeared in the world with its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas, in this generation with its recluses and Brahmins, with its princes and its people. And even in those abysmal world inter-spaces of vacancy, gloom, and utter darkness, where the moon and the sun, mighty and powerful as they are, cannot make their light prevail – there too a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendor of the gods appeared. And the beings born there perceived each other by that light: "So other beings, indeed, have appeared here." And this ten-thousand-fold world system shook and quaked and trembled, and there too a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendor of the gods appeared.’ That when the Bodhisattva came forth from his mother’s womb, then a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendor of the gods appeared… this too I remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One." "That being so, Ananda, remember this too as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Tathágata: Here Ananda, for the Tathágata feelings are known as they arise, as they are present, as they disappear; perceptions are known as they arise, as they are present, as they disappear; thoughts are known as they arise, as they are present, as they disappear. Remember this too, Ananda, as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Tathágata."
Wonderful And Marvelous|1|19| "Venerable sir, since for the Blessed One feelings are known as they arise, as they are present, as they disappear; Perceptions are known as they arise, as they are present, as they disappear; Thoughts are known as they arise, as they are present, as they disappear – this too I remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One." That is what the venerable Ananda said. The Teacher approved. The Bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the venerable Ananda’s words.
The Discourse On Wonderful Things|1|1| I heard thus: At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anathapindika in Jeta’s grove in Savatthi. Then a lot of Bhikkhus after the mid-day meal, were assembled and seated in the attendance hall and this conversation arose among them  ‘Friends, it is wonderful and surprising how the Thus Gone One knows the Enlightened Ones of yore. How they came to final extinction, cut the diffused-ness of the world, cut short their journey and came to the end of the journey and end of all un-pleasantness. Saying, those Blessed Ones were of such birth, name, clan, virtues, thoughts, wisdom, abiding and such releases.’ When this was said venerable Ananda said thus; ‘Friends, indeed the Thus Gone One has wonderful and surprising things and is endowed with them.’ When this conversation was going on, the Blessed One got up from his seclusion approached the attendance hall, sat on the prepared seat and addressed the Bhikkhus. ‘Bhikkhus, with what talk were you seated here and what other talk did take place?’ ‘Venerable sir, after the mid-day meal, we were assembled and seated in the attendance hall and this conversation arose among us. Friends, it is wonderful and surprising how the Thus Gone One knows the Enlightened Ones of yore. How they came to final extinction, cut the diffused-ness of the world, cut short their journey and came to the end of the journey and end of all unpleasantness.

The House On Fire|1|1| I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery. Then a certain devata, in the far extreme of the night, her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta's Grove, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, stood to one side. As she was standing there, she recited these verses in the Blessed One's presence: 
The House On Fire|1|2| When a house is on fire the vessel salvaged is the one that will be of use,  not the one left there to burn. So when the world is on fire with aging and death, one should salvage one's wealth by giving:  what’s given is well salvaged. What's given bears fruit as pleasure.  What isn't given does not:  thieves take it away, or kings;  it gets burnt by fire or lost. Then in the end one leaves the body together with one's possessions. Knowing this, the intelligent man enjoys possessions and gives. Having enjoyed and given in line with his means, un-censured he goes to the heavenly state.
The Fire Sermon|1|1| Thus have I heard: The Blessed One was once living at Gayaslsa in Gaya with a thousand Bhikkhus. There he addressed the Bhikkhus: Bhikkhus, all is burning. And what is all that is burning? Bhikkhus, the eye is burning, visible forms are burning, visual consciousness is burning, visual impression is burning, also whatever sensation, pleasant or painful or neither painful, nor pleasant, arises on account of the visual impression, that too is burning. Burning with what? Burning with the fire of craving, with the fire of hate, with the fire of delusion; I say it is burning with birth, aging and death, with sorrows, with lamentations, with pains, with grief’s, and with despairs.
The Fire Sermon|1|2| The ear is burning, sounds are burning, auditory consciousness is burning, auditory impression is burning, also whatever sensation, pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant, arises on account of the auditory impression, that too is burning. Burning with what? Burning with the fire of craving...
The Fire Sermon|1|3| The nose is burning, odors are burning, olfactory consciousness is burning, olfactory impression is burning, also whatever sensation, pleasant or painful, or neither painful nor pleasant, arises on account of the olfactory impression, that too is burning. Burning with what? Burning with the fire of craving...
The Fire Sermon|1|4| The tongue is burning, favors are burning, gustative consciousness is burning, gustative impression is burning, also whatever sensation, pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant, arises on account of the gustative impression, that too is burning. Burning with what? Burning with the fire of craving... The body is burning, tangible things are burning, tactile consciousness is burning, tactile impression is burning, also whatever sensation, pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant, arises on account of the tactile sensation, that too is burning. Burning with what? Burning with the fire of craving...
The Fire Sermon|1|5| The mind is burning, mental objects (ideas, etc.) are burning, mental consciousness is burning, mental impression is burning, also whatever sensation, pleasant o painful or neither painful nor pleasant, arises on account of the mental impression is burning. Burning with what? Burning with the fire of craving, with the fire of hate, with the fire of delusion; I say it is burning with birth, aging and death, with sorrows, with lamentations, with pains, with grief’s, and with despairs. Bhikkhus, a learned and noble disciple, who sees things thus, becomes dispassionate with regard to the eye, becomes dispassionate with regard to visible forms, becomes dispassionate with regard to the visual consciousness, becomes dispassionate with regard to the visual impression, also whatever sensation, pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant, arises on account of the visual impression, with regard to that too he becomes dispassionate.
The Fire Sermon|1|6| He becomes dispassionate with regard to the ear, with regard to sounds... He becomes dispassionate with regard to the nose... with regard to odors... He becomes dispassionate with regard to the tongue...with regard to favors.... He becomes dispassionate with regard to the body... with regard to tangible things... He becomes dispassionate with regard to the mind... with regard to mental consciousness, becomes dispassionate with regard to mental impression, also whatever sensation, pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant, arises on account of mental impression, with regard to that too he becomes dispassionate.
The Fire Sermon|1|7| Being dispassionate, he becomes detached; through detachment he is liberated. When liberated there is knowledge that he is liberated. And he knows: Birth is exhausted, the holy life has been lived, what has to be done is done, there is no more left to be done on this account. This the Blessed One said. The Bhikkhus were glad, and they rejoiced at his words. While this exposition was being delivered, the minds of those thousand Bhikkhus were liberated from impurities, without attachment. 
The Fire Sermon|2|1| I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Varanasi in Gaya, at Gaya Head, with 1,000 monks. There he addressed the monks: 'Monks, the All is aflame. What All is aflame? The eye is aflame. Forms are aflame. Visual consciousness is aflame. Visual contact is aflame. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on visual contact, experienced as pleasure, pain, or neither-pleasure-nor-pain that too is aflame. Aflame with what? Aflame with the fire of passion, the fire of aversion, the fire of delusion. Aflame, I say, with birth, ageing death, with sorrows, lamentations, pains, grief’s despairs.
The Fire Sermon|2|2| 'The ear is aflame. Sounds are aflame...
The Fire Sermon|2|3| 'The nose is aflame. Odors are aflame...
The Fire Sermon|2|4| 'The tongue is aflame. Flavors are aflame...
The Fire Sermon|2|5| 'The body is aflame. Tactile sensations are aflame...
The Fire Sermon|2|6| 'The intellect is aflame. Ideas are aflame. Mental consciousness is aflame. Mental contact is aflame. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on mental contact, experienced as pleasure, pain, or neither-pleasure-nor-pain that too is aflame. Aflame with what? Aflame with the fire of passion, the fire of aversion, the fire of delusion. Aflame, I say, with birth, ageing, & death, with sorrows, lamentations, pains, grief's & despairs.
The Fire Sermon|2|7| 'Seeing thus, the instructed Noble disciple grows disenchanted with the eye, disenchanted with forms, disenchanted with visual consciousness, disenchanted with visual contact. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on visual contact, experienced as pleasure, pain, or neither-pleasure-nor-pain: He grows disenchanted with that too.
The Fire Sermon|2|8| 'He grows disenchanted with the ear... 'He grows disenchanted with the nose... 'He grows disenchanted with the tongue... 'He grows disenchanted with the body...'He grows disenchanted with the intellect, disenchanted with ideas, disenchanted with mental consciousness, disenchanted with mental contact. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on mental contact, experienced as pleasure, pain, or neither-pleasure-nor-pain: He grows disenchanted with that too. Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is released. With release, there is the knowledge, "Released." He discerns that, "Birth is depleted, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world."'
The Fire Sermon|2|9| That is what the Blessed One said. Glad at heart, the monks delighted at his words. And while this explanation was being given, the hearts of the 1,000 monks, through no clinging (not being sustained), were released from the mental effluents.
Benefits to be Obtained From Wealth|1|1| Then Anathapindika the householder went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him: "There are these five benefits that can be obtained from wealth. Which five?
Benefits to be Obtained From Wealth|1|2| "There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones -- using the wealth earned through his efforts and enterprise, amassed through the strength of his arm, and piled up through the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained -- provides himself with pleasure and satisfaction, and maintains that pleasure rightly. He provides his mother and father with pleasure and satisfaction, and maintains that pleasure rightly. He provides his children, his wife, his slaves, servants, and assistants with pleasure and satisfaction, and maintains that pleasure rightly. This is the first benefit that can be obtained from wealth.
Benefits to be Obtained From Wealth|1|3| "Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones -- using the wealth earned through his efforts and enterprise, amassed through the strength of his arm, and piled up through the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained -- provides his friends and associates with pleasure and satisfaction, and maintains that pleasure rightly. This is the second benefit that can be obtained from wealth.
Benefits to be Obtained From Wealth|1|4| "Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones -- using the wealth earned through his efforts and enterprise, amassed through the strength of his arm, and piled up through the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained -- wards off from calamities coming from fire, flood, kings, thieves, or hateful heirs, and keeps himself safe. This is the third benefit that can be obtained from wealth.
Benefits to be Obtained From Wealth|1|5| "Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones -- using the wealth earned through his efforts and enterprise, amassed through the strength of his arm, and piled up through the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained -- performs the five oblations: to relatives, guests, the dead, kings, and devas. This is the fourth benefit that can be obtained from wealth. "Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones -- using the wealth earned through his efforts and enterprise, amassed through the strength of his arm, and piled up through the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained -- institutes offerings of supreme aim, heavenly, resulting in happiness, leading to heaven, given to priests and contemplatives who abstain from intoxication and heedlessness, who endure all things with patience and humility, each taming himself, each restraining himself, each taking himself to Unbinding. This is the fifth benefit that can be obtained from wealth.
Benefits to be Obtained From Wealth|1|6| "If it so happens that, when a disciple of the noble ones obtains these five benefits from wealth, his wealth goes to depletion, the thought occurs to him, 'Even though my wealth has gone to depletion, I have obtained the five benefits that can be obtained from wealth,' and he feels no remorse. If it so happens that, when a disciple of the noble ones obtains these five benefits from wealth, his wealth increases, the thought occurs to him, 'I have obtained the five benefits that can be obtained from wealth, and my wealth has increased,' and he feels no remorse. So he feels no remorse in either case."
Benefits to be Obtained From Wealth|1|7| 'My wealth has been enjoyed, my dependents supported, protected from calamities by me. I have given supreme offerings and performed the five oblations. I have provided for the virtuous, the restrained, followers of the holy life. For whatever aim a wise householder would desire wealth, that aim I have attained. I have done what will not lead to future distress.' When this is recollected by a mortal, a person established in the Dhamma of the Noble Ones, he is praised in this life and, after death, rejoices in heaven.
Advice to Venerable Punna|1|1| I heard thus: At one time the Blessed One was living in Anathapindika’s monastery, in Jeta’s grove in Savatthi. Then venerable Punna getting up from his seclusion in the evening, approached the Blessed One, worshipped sat on a side and said. ‘Venerable sir, it is good, if I’m advised in short, so that I could abide alone and secluded, zealous to dispel diligently.’ ‘Then Punna, listen, I will advice you.’ Venerable Punna agreed and the Blessed said.
Advice to Venerable Punna|1|2| ‘Punna, there are pleasing, agreeable, forms cognizable by eye-consciousness, arousing fondness, attachment and sensual desires. The Bhikkhu, delights, welcomes and clings to them, and interest arises. Punna, I say, the arising of interest is the arising of unpleasantness. There are pleasing agreeable sounds cognizable by ear-consciousness, scents cognizable by nose-consciousness, tastes cognizable by tongue consciousness, touches cognizable by body consciousness and ideas cognizable by mind consciousness, arousing fondness, attachment and sensual desires. The Bhikkhu, delights, welcomes and clings to them, and interest arises. Punna, I say, the arising of interest is the arising of unpleasantness.
Advice to Venerable Punna|1|3| Punna, there are pleasing, agreeable, forms, cognizable by eye-consciousness, arousing fondness, attachment and sensual desires. The Bhikkhu, does not delight welcome and cling to them, and the interest ceases. Punna, I say, the cessation of interest is the cessation of unpleasantness. There are pleasing, agreeable, sounds cognizable by ear-consciousness, scents cognizable by nose-consciousness, tastes cognizable by tongue consciousness, touches cognizable by body consciousness and ideas cognizable by mind consciousness, arousing fondness, attachment and sensual desires. The Bhikkhu, does not delight, welcome and cling to them, and so the interest ceases. Punna, I say, the cessation of interest is the cessation of unpleasantness.
Advice to Venerable Punna|1|4| Punna, I have advised you in short. Now in which state will you abide?’ ‘Venerable sir, now that I’m advised in short, I will abide in the Sunaparanta state.’ ‘Punna, the people of Sunaparanta are rough, if they scold and abuse you, what will you do?’ ‘Venerable sir, if the people of Sunaparanta scold and abuse me. It will occur to me, indeed the people of Sunaparanta are good, they do not hurt me with their hands.’ ‘Punna, if the people of Sunaparanta hurt you with their hands, what will you do?’ ‘Venerable sir, if the people of Sunaparanta hurt me with their hands, it will occur to me, indeed the people of Sunaparanta are good, they do not hurt me with clods.’ ‘Punna, if the people of Sunaparanta hurt you with clods, what will you do?’ ‘Venerable sir, if the people of Sunaparanta hurt me with clods, it will occur to me, indeed the people of Sunaparanta are good, they do not hurt me with a stick.’ ‘Punna, if the people of Sunaparanta hurt you with a stick, what will you do?’ ‘Venerable sir, if the people of Sunaparanta hurt me with a stick, it will occur to me, indeed the people of Sunaparanta are good, they do not hurt me with a weapon’ ‘Punna, if the people of Sunaparanta hurt you with a weapon, what will you do?’ ‘Venerable sir, if the people of Sunaparanta hurt me with a weapon, it will occur to me, indeed the people of Sunaparanta are good, they do not end my life with a sharp weapon’ ‘Punna, if the people of Sunaparanta put an end to your life with a sharp weapon, what will you do?’ ‘Venerable sir, if the people of Sunaparanta would put an end to my life, it will occur to me thus. There are disciples of the Blessed One, who loathing the body and life search for an assassin. Here I have got an assassin even without a search." ‘Good! Punna, it is possible for you to abide in Sunaparanta endowed with that appeasement in the Teaching. You may do the fit now.’ Venerable Punna, delighting in the words of the Blessed One, got up from his seat, worshipped the Blessed One, and moving with his right side towards the Blessed One showed reverence. Putting his dwelling in order and taking bowl and robes, he left on a tour to Sunaparanta and arrived there in due order. Then he abode in that state. Venerable Punna, during that same rains, brought forth about five hundred male disciples and about five hundred female disciples and realized the three knowledge’s and venerable Punna attained final extinction. Then many Bhikkhus, approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said. ‘Venerable sir, the clansman who was advised by the Blessed One in short has passed away. What are his movements after death?’
Advice to Venerable Punna|1|5| ‘Bhikkhus, the clansman Punna is wise. He stood on his own in the Teaching. (*1) He did not worry me about questions in the Teaching. He has attained final extinction.’ The Blessed One said thus and those Bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One.
The Guest House|1|1| "In a guest house, O monks, people from the east may take lodgings, or people from the west, north or south. People from the warrior caste may come and take lodgings there, and also Brahmans, middle class people and menials. "Similarly, O monks, there arise in this body various kinds of feelings; there arise pleasant feelings, painful feelings and neutral feelings; worldly feelings that are pleasant, painful or neutral, and unworldly (spiritual) feelings that are pleasant, painful and neutral."
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|1| Thus have I heard. Once the Lord was staying at Savatthi, at the mansion of Migara’s mother in the East Park. And at that time Vasettha and Bharadvaja were living among the monks, hoping to become monks themselves. And in the evening, the Lord rose from his secluded meditation and came out of the mansion, and started walking up and down in its shade. Vasettha noticed this and he said to Bharadvaja: ‘Friend Bharadvaja, the Lord has come out and is walking up and down. Let us approach him. We might be fortunate enough to hear a talk on Dhamma from the lord himself.’ Yes, indeed,’ said Bharadvaja, so they went up to the lord, saluted him, and fell into step with him.
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|2| Then the lord said to Vasettha: ‘Vasettha, you two are Brahmins born and bred, and you have gone forth from the household life into homelessness from Brahmin families. Do not the Brahmins revile and abuse you?’
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|3| ‘Indeed, lord, the Brahmins do revile and abuse us. They don’t hold back with their usual flood of reproaches.’ ‘Well, Vasettha, what kind of reproaches do they fling at you?’ ‘Lord, what the Brahmins say is this, "The Brahmins caste is the highest caste—other castes are base; the Brahmin caste is fair, other castes are dark; Brahmins are purified, non-Brahmins are not, the Brahmins are the true children of Brahma, [1] born from his mouth, born of Brahma, heirs of Brahma. And you, you have deserted the highest class and gone over to the base class of shave-ling petty ascetics, servants, dark fellows born of Brahma’s Foot! It’s not right, it’s not proper for you to mix with such people!" That is the way the Brahmins abuse us, lord.’
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|4| ‘Then, Vasettha, the Brahmins have forgotten their ancient tradition when they say that. Because we can see Brahmin women, the wives of Brahmins, who menstruate and become pregnant, have babies, and give milk. And yet these womb-born Brahmins talk about being born from Brahma’s mouth…These Brahmins misrepresent Brahma, tell lies and earn much demerit.
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|5| ‘There are, Vasettha, these four castes: The Khattiyas, The Brahmins, the merchants and the artisans. And sometimes a Khattiya takes life, takes what is not given, commits sexual misconduct, tells lies, indulges in slander, harsh speech or idle chatter, is grasping, malicious, or of wrong views. Thus such things as are immoral and considered so, blameworthy and considered so, to be avoided and considered so, ways unbefitting an Ariyan and considered so, black with black result and blamed by the wise, are sometimes to found among the Khattiyas, and the same applies to Brahmins, merchants, and artisans.
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|6| ‘Sometimes too, a Khattiya refrains from taking life, does not take what is not given, refrains from sexual misconduct, speaks truth, shuns slander, harsh speech or idle chatter, is not grasping, malicious, or of wrong views. Thus such things are moral and considered so, blameless and considered so, to be followed and considered so, ways befitting an Ariyan and considered so, bright with bright results and praised by the wise, are sometimes found among the Khattiyas, and likewise among Brahmins, merchants, and artisans. ‘Now since both dark and bright qualities, which are blamed and praised by the wise, are scattered indiscriminately among the four castes, the wise do not recognize the claim about the Brahmin caste being the highest. Why is that? Because, Vasettha, anyone from the four castes who becomes a monk, an Arahant who has destroyed the corruptions, who has lived the life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached the highest goal, destroyed the fetter of becoming, and become emancipated through super-knowledge—he is proclaims supreme by virtue of Dhamma and not of non-Dhamma.
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|7| Dhamma is the best thing for people In this life and the next as well. ‘This illustration will make clear to you how Dhamma is best in this world and the next. King Pasenadi of Kosala knows: "The ascetic Gotama has gone forth from the neighboring clan of the Sakyans." Now the Sakyans are vassals of the King of Kosala. They offer him humble service and salute him, rise and do him homage and pay him fitting service and just as the Sakyans offer the King humble service and salute him, rise and do him homage and pay him fitting service so likewise does the King offer humble service to the Tathágata, thinking, "If the ascetic Gotama is well-born, I am ill-born; if the ascetic Gotama is strong, I am weak; if the ascetic Gotama is pleasant to look at, I am ill-favored; if the ascetic Gotama is influential, I am of little influence." Now it is because of honoring the Dhamma, making much of the Dhamma, esteeming the Dhamma, doing reverent homage to the Dhamma that King Pasenadi does humble service to the Tathágata and pays him fitting service:
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|8| Dhamma is the best thing for people In this life and the next as well. Vasettha, all of you, though of different birth, name, clan and family, who have gone forth from the household life into homelessness, if you are asked who you are, you should reply: "We are ascetics, followers of the Sakyan." [2] He whose faith in the Tathágata is settled, rooted, established, solid, unshakable by any ascetic or Brahmin, any deva or mara or Brahma or anyone in the world, can truly say: "I am a true son of the Blessed Lord, born of his mouth, born of Dhamma, created by Dhamma, an heir of Dhamma." Why is that? Because, Vasettha, this designates the Tathágata: "The Body of Dhamma," that is "The Body of Brahma," [3] or "Become Dhamma," that is "Become Brahma." [4] ‘There comes a time, Vasettha, when, sooner or later after a long period this world contracts. At a time of contraction, beings are mostly born in the Abhassara Brahma world. And there they dwell, mind-made, feeding on delight, self luminous, moving through the air, glorious—and they stay like that for a very long time. But sooner or later, after a very long period, this world begins to expand again. At a time of expansion, the beings from the Abhassara Brahma world, having passed away from there, are mostly reborn in this world. Here they dwell, mind-made, feeding on delight, self-luminous, moving through the air, glorious—[5] and they stay like that for a very long time. ‘At that period, Vasettha, there was just one mass of water, and all was darkness, blinding darkness. Neither moon or sun appeared, no constellations or stars appeared, night and day were not yet distinguished, nor months and fortnights, nor years and seasons; there was no male and female, beings being reckoned just as beings. [6] And sooner or later, after a very long period of time, savory earth spread itself over the waters where those beings were. It looked just like the skin that forms itself over hot milk as it cools. It was endowed with color, smell, and taste. It was the color of fine ghee or butter and it was very sweet, like pure wild honey. ‘Then some being of a greedy nature said: "I say, what can this be?" and tasted the savory earth on its finger. In so doing, it became taken with the flavor, and craving arose in it. Then other beings, taking their cue from that one, also tasted the stuff with their fingers. They too were taken with the flavor, and craving arose in them. So they set to with their hands, breaking off pieces of the stuff in order to eat it. And the result was that their self luminance disappeared. And as a result of the disappearance of their self luminance the moon and the sun appeared, night and day were distinguished, months and fortnights appeared, and the year and its seasons. To that extent the world re-evolved.
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|9| ‘And those beings continued for a very long time feasting on this savory earth, feeding on it and being nourished by it. And as they did so, their bodies became coarser, and a difference in looks developed among them. Some beings became good looking, others ugly. And the good looking ones despised the others, saying: "We are better looking than they are." And because they became arrogant and conceited about their looks, the savory earth disappeared. At this they came together and lamented, crying, "Oh, that flavor! Oh, that flavor!" and so nowadays when people say, "Oh, that flavor!" when they get something nice, they are repeating an ancient saying without realizing it.
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|10| ‘And then, when the savory earth disappeared, a fungus cropped up, in the manner of a mushroom. It was of good color, smell, and taste. It was the color of fine ghee or butter, and it was very sweet, like pure wild honey. And those beings set to and ate the fungus. And this lasted for a very long time. And as they continued to feed on the fungus, so their bodies become coarser still, and the difference in their looks increased still more. And the good looking ones despised the others…and because they became arrogant and conceited about their looks, the sweet fungus disappeared. Next, creepers appeared, shooting up like bamboo…and they too were very sweet, like pure wild honey.
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|11| ‘And those beings set to and fed on those creepers. And as they did so, their bodies became even coarser, and the difference in their looks increased still more…and they became still more arrogant, and so the creepers disappeared too. At this they came together and lamented, crying: "Alas, our creepers gone! What have we lost!" and so now today when people, one being asked why they are upset, say: "Oh what have we lost!" they are repeating an ancient saying without realizing it.
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|13| ‘And then, after the creepers had disappeared, rice appeared in open spaces, free from powder and from husks, fragrant and clean grained. And what they had taken in the evening for supper had grown again and was ripe in the morning, and what they had taken in the morning for breakfast was ripe again by evening, with no sign of reaping. And these beings set to and fed on this rice, and this lasted for a very long time. And as they did so, their bodies became coarser still, and the difference in their looks became even greater. And the females developed female sex organs and the males developed male sex organs. And the women became excessively preoccupied with the men, and the men with the women. Owing to this excessive preoccupation with each other, passion was aroused, and their bodies burnt with lust. And later because of this burning, they indulged in sexual activity. But those who saw them indulging threw dust, ashes, or cow-dung at them, crying: "Die, you filthy beast! How can one being do such things to another!" Just as today, in some districts, when a daughter-in-law is led out, some people throw dirt at her, some ashes, and some cow dung, without realizing that they are repeating an ancient observance. What was considered bad form in those days is now considered good form.
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|14| ‘And those beings who in those days indulged in sex were not allowed into a village or town for one or two months. Accordingly those who indulged for an excessively long period in such immoral practices began to build themselves dwellings so as to indulge under cover.
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|15| ‘Now it occurred to one of those beings who was inclined to laziness, "Well now, why should I be bothered to gather rice in the evening for supper and in the morning for breakfast? Why shouldn’t I gather it all at once for both meals?" And he did so. Then another one came to him and said, "Come on, lets go rice-gathering." "No need, my friend, I’ve gathered enough for both meals." Then the other, following his example, gathered enough rice for two days at a time, saying, "That should be about enough." Then another being came to that second one, "Come on, lets go rice gathering." "No need my friend, I’ve gathered enough for two days." (The same for four, then eight days.) However, when those beings made a store of rice and lived on that, husk-powder and husk began to envelop the grain, and where it was reaped it did not grow again, and the cut place showed, and the rice grew in separate clusters.
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|16| ‘And then those beings came together lamenting, "Wicked ways have become rife among us: at first we were mind made, feeding on delight…(All the events are repeated down to the latest development, each fresh change being said to be due to ‘wicked and unwholesome ways)…and the rice grows in separate clusters! So now let us divide up the rice into fields with boundaries." So they did so.
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|17| ‘Then, Vasettha, one greedy-natured being, while watching over his own plot, took another plot that was not given to him, and enjoyed the fruits of it. So they seized hold of him and said, "You’ve done a wicked thing, taking another’s plot like that! Don’t ever do such a thing again!" "I won’t," he said, but he did the same thing a second and a third time. Again, he was seized and rebuked, and some hit him with their fists, some with stones, and some with sticks. And in this way, Vasettha, taking what was not given, and censuring, and lying, and punishment took their origin.
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|18|‘Then those beings came together and lamented the arising of these evil things among them: taking what was not given, censuring, lying, and punishment. And they thought: "Suppose we were to appoint a certain being who would show anger where anger was due, censure those who deserved it, and banish those who deserved banishment! And in return we would grant him a share of the rice." So they went to the one among them who was the handsomest, the best-looking, most pleasant and capable, and asked him to do this for them in return for a share of the rice, and he agreed.
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|19| "The People’s Choice" is the meaning of Maha-Sammata, [7] which is the first regular title to be introduced. "Lord of the Fields" is the meaning of Khattiya, the second such title. And "He Gladdens Others With Dhamma" is the meaning of Raja, the third title to be introduced. This, then, Vasettha, is the origin of the class of Khattiyas, in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them. They originated among the very same beings, like ourselves, no different and in accordance with Dhamma, not otherwise.
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|20| Dhamma is the best thing for people In this life and the next as well. ‘Then some beings thought, "Evil things have appeared among beings, such as taking what is not given, censuring, lying, punishment and banishment. We ought to put aside evil and unwholesome things." And they did so. "They Put Aside Evil and Unwholesome Things" is the meaning of Brahmin, which is the first regular title to be introduced for such people. They made leaf-huts in forest places and meditated in them. With the smoking fire gone out, with pestle cast aside, gathering alms for their evening and morning meals, they went away to a village, town, or royal city to seek their food, and then they returned to their leaf-huts to meditate. People saw this and noted how they meditated. "They Meditate" is the meaning of Jhayaka, which is the second regular title to be introduced.
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|21| ‘However, some of those beings, not being able to meditate in leaf huts, settled around towns and villages and compiled books. People saw them doing this and not meditating. ‘Now "These Do Not Meditate" is the meaning of Ajjhayaka, which is the third regular title to be introduced. At that time it was regarded as a low designation, but now it is the higher. This, then, Vasettha, is the origin of the class of Brahmins in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them. Their origin was from among the very same beings, like themselves, not different, and in accordance with Dhamma, not otherwise.
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|22| Dhamma is the best thing for people In this life and the next as well. ‘And then, Vasettha, some of those beings, having paired off, adopted various trades, and this "various" is the meaning of Vessa, which came to be the regular title for such people. This then is the origin of the class of Vessas, in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them. Their origin was from among these very same beings like themselves, no different, and in accordance with Dhamma, not otherwise.
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|23| ‘And then, Vasettha, those beings that remained went in for hunting. "They Are Base Who Live By The Chase," and that is the meaning of Sudda, which came to be the regular title for such people. This, then, is the origin of the class of Suddas [8] in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them. Their origin was from among these very same beings like themselves, no different, and in accordance with Dhamma, not otherwise.
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|24| ‘And then, Vasettha, it came about that some Khattiya, dissatisfied with his own Dhamma, went forth from the household life into homelessness, thinking, "I will become an ascetic." And a Brahmin did likewise, a Vessa did likewise, and so did a Sudda. And from these four classes the class of ascetics came into existence. Their origin was from among these very same beings, like themselves, no different, and in accordance with Dhamma, not otherwise.
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|25| Dhamma is the best thing for people In this life and the next as well. ‘And, Vasettha, a Khattiya who has led a bad life in body, speech and thought, and who has wrong view will, in consequence of such wrong views and deeds, at the breaking up of the body after death, be reborn in a state of loss, an ill fate, the downfall, the hell-state. So too will a Brahmin, a Vessa or a Sudda. ‘Likewise, a Khattiya who has led a good life in body, speech, and thought, and who has right view will, in consequence of such right view and deeds, at the breaking up of the body after death, be reborn in a good destiny, in a heaven-state. So too will a Brahmin, a Vessa or a Sudda.
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|26| ‘And a Khattiya who has performed deeds of both kinds in body, speech and thought, and whose view is mixed will, in consequence of such mixed views and deeds, at the breaking-up of the body after death, experience both pleasure and pain. So too will a Brahmin, a Vessa, or a Sudda. ‘And a Khattiya who is restrained in Body, speech and thougth, and who has developed the seven requisites of enlightenment, will attain to parinirvana in this very life. So too will a Brahmin, a Vessa, or a Sudda.
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|27| And, Vasettha, whoever of these four castes, as a monk, becomes an Arahant who has destroyed the corruptions, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, attained to the highest goal, completely destroyed the fetter of becoming, and become liberated by the highest insight, he is declared to be chief among them in accordance with Dhamma, and not otherwise.
On Knowledge of Beginnings|1|1| Dhamma’s the best thing for people In this life and the next as well. Vasettha, it was Brahma Sanankumara who spoke this verse: The Khattiya’s best among those who value clan; He with knowledge and conduct is best of gods and men. This verse was rightly sung, not wrongly, rightly spoken, not wrongly, connected with profit, not unconnected. I too say, Vasettha: The Khattiya’s best among those who value clan; He with knowledge and conduct is best of gods and men. Thus the lord spoke, and Vasettha and Bharadvaja were delighted and rejoiced at his words.
To Vacchagotta on Fire|1|1| I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi, at Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's park. Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, he sat down to one side. As he was sitting there he asked the Blessed One: "How is it, Master Gotama, does Master Gotama hold the view: 'the cosmos is eternal: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless'?" "...No." "Then does Master Gotama hold the view: 'the cosmos is not eternal: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless'?" "...No." "Then does Master Gotama hold the view: 'the cosmos is finite: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless'?" "...No." "Then does Master Gotama hold the view: 'the cosmos is infinite: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless'?" "...No." "Then does Master Gotama hold the view: 'the soul and the body are the same: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless'?" "...No." "Then does Master Gotama hold the view: 'the soul is one thing and the body another: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless'?" "...No." "Then does Master Gotama hold the view: 'after death a Tathágata exists: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless'?" "...No." "Then does Master Gotama hold the view: 'after death a Tathágata does not exist: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless'?" "...No." "Then does Master Gotama hold the view: 'after death a Tathágata both exists and does not exist: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless'?" "...No." "Then does Master Gotama hold the view: 'after death a Tathágata neither exists nor does not exist: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless'?" "...No." 
To Vacchagotta on Fire|1|2| "How is it, Master Gotama, when Master Gotama is asked if he holds the view 'the cosmos is eternal...' 'After death a Tathágata neither exists nor does not exist: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless,' he says '...no...' in each case. Seeing what drawback, then, is Master Gotama thus entirely dissociated from each of these ten positions?" "Vaccha, the position that 'the cosmos is eternal' is a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views. It is accompanied by suffering, distress, despair, and fever, and it does not lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation; to calm, direct knowledge, full Awakening, Unbinding.
To Vacchagotta on Fire|1|3| "The position that 'the cosmos is not eternal'... "...’The cosmos is finite'... "...’The cosmos is infinite'... "...’The soul and the body are the same'... "...’the soul is one thing and the body another'... "...’After death a Tathágata exists'... "...’After death a Tathágata does not exist'... "...’After death a Tathágata both exists and does not exist'... "...’After death a Tathágata neither exists nor does not exist'... does not lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation; to calm, direct knowledge, full Awakening, Unbinding." 
To Vacchagotta on Fire|1|4| "Does Master Gotama have any position at all?" "A 'position,' Vaccha, is something that a Tathágata has done away with. What a Tathágata sees is this: 'such is form, such its origin, such its disappearance; such is feeling, such its origin, such its disappearance; such is perception... such are mental fabrications... such is consciousness, such its origin, such its disappearance.' Because of this, I say, a Tathágata -- with the ending, fading out, cessation, renunciation, and relinquishment of all construings, all excogitations, all I-making and mine-making and obsession with conceit -- is, through lack of clinging/sustenance, released." "But, Master Gotama, the monk whose mind is thus released: Where does he reappear?"
To Vacchagotta on Fire|1|5| "'Reappear,' Vaccha, doesn't apply." "In that case, Master Gotama, he does not reappear." "'Does not reappear,' Vaccha, doesn't apply." "...Both does and does not reappear." "...Doesn’t apply." "...Neither does nor does not reappear." "...Doesn’t apply."
To Vacchagotta on Fire|1|6| "How is it, Master Gotama, when Master Gotama is asked if the monk reappears... does not reappear... both does and does not reappear... neither does nor does not reappear, he says, '...doesn't apply' in each case. At this point, Master Gotama, I am befuddled; at this point, confused. The modicum of clarity coming to me from your earlier conversation is now obscured." "Of course you're befuddled, Vaccha. Of course you're confused. Deep, Vaccha, is this phenomenon, hard to see, hard to realize, tranquil, refined, beyond the scope of conjecture, subtle, to-be-experienced by the wise. For those with other views, other practices, other satisfactions, other aims, other teachers, it is difficult to know. That being the case, I will now put some questions to you. Answer as you see fit. How do you construe this, Vaccha: If a fire were burning in front of you, would you know that, 'This fire is burning in front of me'?" "...yes..." "And suppose someone were to ask you, Vaccha, 'This fire burning in front of you, dependent on what is it burning?' Thus asked, how would you reply?" "...I would reply, 'This fire burning in front of me is burning dependent on grass and timber as its sustenance.'" "If the fire burning in front of you were to go out, would you know that, 'this fire burning in front of me has gone out'?" "...Yes." "And suppose someone were to ask you, 'this fire that has gone out in front of you, in which direction from here has it gone? East? West? North? Or south?' Thus asked, how would you reply?" "That doesn't apply, Master Gotama. Any fire burning dependent on a sustenance of grass and timber, being unnourished -- from having consumed that sustenance and not being offered any other -- is classified simply as 'out' (unbound)." "Even so, Vaccha, any physical form by which one describing the Tathágata would describe him: That the Tathágata has abandoned, its root destroyed, like an uprooted palm tree, deprived of the conditions of existence, not destined for future arising. Freed from the classification of form, Vaccha, the Tathágata is deep, boundless, hard to fathom, like the sea. 'Reappears' doesn't apply. 'Does not reappear' doesn't apply. 'Both does and does not reappear' doesn't apply. 'Neither reappears nor does not reappear' doesn't apply.
To Vacchagotta on Fire|1|7| "Any feeling... Any perception... Any mental fabrication... "Any consciousness by which one describing the Tathágata would describe him: That the Tathágata has abandoned, its root destroyed, like an uprooted palm tree, deprived of the conditions of existence, not destined for future arising. Freed from the classification of consciousness, Vaccha, the Tathágata is deep, boundless, hard to fathom, like the sea. 'Reappears' doesn't apply. 'Does not reappear' doesn't apply. 'Both does and does not reappear' doesn't apply. 'Neither reappears nor does not reappear' doesn't apply." 
To Vacchagotta on Fire|1|8| When this was said, the wanderer Vacchagotta said to the Blessed One: "Master Gotama, it is as if there were a great sala tree not far from a village or town: From inconstancy, its branches and leaves would wear away, its bark would wear away, its sapwood would wear away, so that on a later occasion -- divested of branches, leaves, bark, and sapwood -- it would stand as pure heartwood. In the same way, Master Gotama's words are divested of branches, leaves, bark, and sapwood and stand as pure heartwood. "Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or were to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama has -- through many lines of reasoning -- made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life."
To Vacchagotta|1|1| I heard thus: At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anathapindika in Jeta’s grove in Savatthi. Then the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta approached the Blessed One exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and said to the Blessed One.
To Vacchagotta|1|2| ‘Good Gotama, the world is eternal this only is the truth and all else is false. Does good Gotama hold this view?’ ‘No, Vaccha, I’m not of that view, the world is eternal, this only is the truth all else is false’. ‘Good Gotama, the world is not eternal, this only is the truth and all else is false Does good Gotama hold this view?’ ‘No, Vaccha, I’m not of that view, the world is not eternal, this only is the truth all else is false’. ‘Good Gotama, the world is limited, this only is the truth and all else is false.

Does good Gotama hold this view.’ ‘No, Vaccha, I’m not of that view, the Thus Gone One is, and is not after death, this only is the truth all else is false.’ ‘Good Gotama, the Thus Gone One neither is, nor is not after death, this only is the truth and all else is false. Does good Gotama hold this view?’ ‘No, Vaccha, I’m not of that view, the Thus Gone One neither is, nor is not after death, this only is the truth all else is false.’
To Vacchagotta|1|3| ‘Good Gotama, when asked, is good Gotama of the view, the world is eternal, this only is the truth, all else is false, it was said you were not of that view. When asked, is good Gotama of the view, the world is not eternal, this only is the truth, all else is false, it was said, you were not of that view. When asked, is good Gotama of the view, the world is limited, this only is the truth, all else is false, it was said you were not of that view. When asked, is good Gotama of the view, the world is not limited, this only is the truth, all else is false, it was said you were not of that view. When asked, is good Gotama of the view, the Thus Gone One is and is not after death, this only is the truth, all else is false, it was said you were not of that view. When asked, is good Gotama of the view, the Thus Gone One neither is, nor is not after death, this only is the truth, all else is false, it was said you were not of that view. Good Gotama, seeing what danger has thrown out all these views?’
To Vacchagotta|1|4| ‘Vaccha, the view, the world is eternal, is a bond of views, is a speculation in views, it is with unpleasantness, with trouble, with burning, not leading to giving up, to detachment, to appeasement, to knowledge, to enlightenment, to cessation and to extinction. The view the world is not eternal…The world is limited,-re- the world is not limited …the soul is the body…the soul is different from the body…the Thus Gone One is, after death…the Thus Gone One is not, after death…the Thus Gone One is and is not after death…the Thus Gone One neither is, nor is not after death is a bond of views, is a speculation in views, it is with unpleasantness, with trouble, with burning, not leading to giving up, to detachment, to appeasement, to knowledge, to enlightenment, to cessation and to extinction. Vaccha, seeing these dangers I have thrown out all these views.’. ‘Does good Gotama hold any other view?’ ‘Vaccha, The Thus Gone One has overcome views. This is the view of the Thus Gone One. This is matter, this is the arising of matter, and this is the fading of matter. This is feeling, this is the arising of feelings and this is the fading of feelings. This is perception, this is the arising of perceptions and this is the fading of perceptions. These are determinations, this is the arising of determinations and this, the fading of determinations. This is consciousness, this is the arising of consciousness and this is fading of consciousness. Therefore, I say the Thus Gone One has destroyed, is detached, has given up and is released, from all imaginings, recollections, and all latent tendencies of me and mine.’
To Vacchagotta|1|5| ‘Good Gotama, where is the thus released mind born?’ ‘Vaccha, is born does not apply’ ‘Then good Gotama, is he not born?’ ‘Vaccha, is not born does not apply.’ ‘Gotama, is he born and not born?’ ‘Vaccha, is born and is not born does not apply.’ ‘Then Gotama, is he neither born, nor not born?’ ‘Vaccha, is neither born, nor is not born, is non applicable..’. ‘When asked where is the thus released mind born, it was said, is born does not apply. When asked is it not born, it was said not born does not apply. When asked is it born and not born, it was said, born and not born does not apply. When asked, is it neither born, nor is not born, it was said neither born nor not born, does not apply. Good Gotama, in this I am completely ignorant and deluded. Whatever little understanding I had with the earlier conversation, has now vanished.’
To Vacchagotta|1|6| ‘Vaccha, your ignorance and delusion is nothing strange. This is deep, difficult to understand peaceful and exalted, not for logical thinking. Is clever and should be experienced by the wise. By one of another sect like you, with some other liking, without being yoked in it and living in it, it cannot be understood. So then Vaccha, I will question you, on this and you may reply as it pleases you. There is a fire burning in front of you, would you know, there is a fire burning in front of me?’ ‘Good Gotama, if a fire burns in front of me, I would know, there’s a fire burning in front of me.’ ‘Vaccha, if you were asked, this fire burning in front of you, on account of what is it burning, how would you reply?’ ‘Good Gotama, if I was asked, this fire burning in front of you, on account of what is it burning, I would reply, this fire burning in front of me is burning on account of grass and sticks.’ ‘Vaccha, if the fire in front of you extinguishes, would you know, this fire in front of me has extinguished?’ ‘Good Gotama, if the fire in front of me extinguishes, I would know, this fire has extinguished’ ‘Vaccha, if you were asked, this fire that has extinguished in which direction did it go, to the east, west, north or south?’ ‘Good, Gotama, it does not apply. That fire burnt on account of grass and sticks, those supports finished, no other supports were supplied, without supports the fire, went out.’
To Vacchagotta|1|7| ‘Vaccha, in that same manner, the matter with which the Thus Gone One is pointed out, is dispelled, uprooted, made a palm stump, made a thing not to grow again: Vaccha, the Thus Gone One is released from the reckonings of matter. It is deep, difficult to fathom, like the great ocean. Is born, does not apply, is not born does not apply. Is born and is not born does not apply, neither is born, nor is not born does not apply. The feelings, with which the Thus Gone One is pointed, are dispelled, uprooted, made palm stumps made things not to grow again: Vaccha, the Thus Gone One is released from the reckonings of feelings. It is deep, difficult to fathom, like the great ocean. Is born does not apply, is not born does not apply. Is born and is not born does not apply. Neither is born nor is not born does not apply. The perceptions, with which the Thus Gone One is pointed, are dispelled, uprooted, made palm stumps, made things not to grow again. Vaccha, the Thus Gone One is released from the reckonings of perceptions. It is deep, difficult to fathom, like the great ocean. Is born does not apply, is not born does not apply, is born and is not born does not apply. Neither is born nor is not born does not apply. The determinations with which the Thus Gone One is pointed out, are dispelled, uprooted, made palm stumps, made things not to grow again: Vaccha, the Thus Gone One is released from the reckonings of determinations. It is deep, difficult to fathom like the great ocean. Is born does not apply, is not born does not apply Is born and is not born does not apply. Neither is born nor is not born does not apply. The consciousness with which the Thus Gone One is pointed out, is dispelled, uprooted, made a palm stump, made a thing not to grow again. Vaccha, the Thus Gone One is released from the reckonings of consciousness. It is deep, difficult to fathom like the great ocean. Is born does not apply, is not born does not apply. Is born and is not born does not apply. Neither is born nor is not born does not apply.’ When this was said the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta said thus to the Blessed One, close to the village or hamlet, there is a huge Sala tree, because of impermanence, its leaves, branches, bark, shoots and sapwood fall off and is left with only the heartwood. In the same manner, on account of the words of good Gotama, with my leaves and branches pulled out, shoots pulled out, the bark removed, the sap removed, I stand as the pure heartwood. I understand good Gotama, it is as though something over turned is reinstalled, something covered is made manifest. As though the path is shown to someone who had lost his way. As though an oil lamp is lighted, for those who have sight to see forms in the dark. Now, I take refuge in good Gotama, in the Teaching, in the Community of Bhikkhus. May the Blessed One bear me as a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today until life lasts.

Subduing Hatred|1|2| "When one gives birth to hatred for an individual, one should develop good will for that individual. Thus the hatred for that individual should be subdued.
Subduing Hatred|1|3| "When one gives birth to hatred for an individual, one should develop compassion for that individual... equanimity toward that individual... one should pay him no mind and pay him no attention...

Whatever kamma he does, for good or for evil, to that will he fall heir.' Thus the hatred for that individual should be subdued.

The Thoroughbred|1|1| "Endowed with three characteristics, a king's excellent thoroughbred steed is worthy of a king, the wealth of a king, and counts as one of the king's own limbs. Which three? There is the case where a king's excellent thoroughbred steed is consummate in beauty, consummate in strength, and consummate in speed. Endowed with these three characteristics is a king's excellent thoroughbred steed worthy of a king, the wealth of a king, and counts as one of the king's own limbs.
The Thoroughbred|1|2| "In the same way, a monk endowed with these three qualities is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, an unexcelled field of merit for the world. Which three? There is the case where a monk is consummate in beauty, consummate in strength, and consummate in speed.
The Thoroughbred|1|3| "And how is a monk consummate in beauty? There is the case where a monk is virtuous. He dwells restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha, consummate in his behavior & sphere of activity. He trains himself, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the slightest fault. This is how a monk is consummate in beauty.
The Thoroughbred|1|4| "And how is a monk consummate in strength?

To the Fatalists' Student|1|1| Thus Have I Heard: On one occasion Ven. Ananda was staying in Kosambi at Ghosita's monastery. Then a certain householder, a disciple of the Fatalists (Ajivakas), went to him and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to Ven. Ananda, "Among us, sir, whose Dhamma is well-taught? Who has practiced well in this world? Who in the world is well-gone?"
To the Fatalists' Student|1|2| "In that case, householder, I will question you in return. Answer as you see fit. Now, what do you think: those who teach a Dhamma for the abandoning of passion, for the abandoning of aversion, for the abandoning of delusion -- is their Dhamma well-taught or not? Or how does this strike you?"
To the Fatalists' Student|1|3| "Sir, those who teach a Dhamma for the abandoning of passion, for the abandoning of aversion, for the abandoning of delusion -- their Dhamma is well-taught. That's how it strikes me." "And what do you think, householder: those who have practiced for the abandoning of passion, for the abandoning of aversion, for the abandoning of delusion -- have they practiced well in this world or not? Or how does this strike you?"
To the Fatalists' Student|1|4| "Sir, those who have practiced for the abandoning of passion, for the abandoning of aversion, for the abandoning of delusion -- they have practiced well in this world. That's how it strikes me." "And what do you think, householder: those whose passion is abandoned, its root destroyed, like an uprooted palm tree, deprived of the conditions of existence, not destined for future arising; those whose aversion is abandoned ... whose delusion is abandoned, its root destroyed, like an uprooted palm tree, deprived of the conditions of existence, not destined for future arising: are they, in this world, well-gone or not? Or how does this strike you?"
To the Fatalists' Student|1|5| "Sir, those whose passion ... aversion ... delusion is abandoned, its root destroyed, like an uprooted palm tree, deprived of the conditions of existence, not destined for future arising: they, in this world, are well-gone. That's how it strikes me." "In this way, householder, you have answered yourself: 'Those who teach a Dhamma for the abandoning of passion, for the abandoning of aversion, for the abandoning of delusion -- their Dhamma is well-taught. Those who have practiced for the abandoning of passion, for the abandoning of aversion, for the abandoning of delusion -- they have practiced well in this world. Those whose passion ... aversion ... delusion is abandoned, its root destroyed, like an uprooted palm tree, deprived of the conditions of existence, not destined for future arising: they, in this world, are well-gone.'"
To the Fatalists' Student|1|6| "How amazing, sir. How astounding, that there is neither extolling of one's own Dhamma nor deprecation of another's, but just the teaching of the Dhamma in its proper sphere, speaking to the point without mentioning oneself.
To the Fatalists' Student|1|7| "You, venerable sir, teach the Dhamma for the abandoning of passion ... aversion ... delusion. Your Dhamma is well-taught. You have practiced for the abandoning of passion ... aversion ... delusion. You have practiced well in this world. Your passion ... aversion ... delusion is abandoned, its root destroyed, like an uprooted palm tree, deprived of the conditions of existence, not destined for future arising. You, in this world, are well-gone.
To the Fatalists' Student|1|8| "Magnificent, Master Ananda! Magnificent! In many ways has Master Ananda made the Dhamma clear -- just as if he were to place upright what has been overturned, to reveal what has been hidden, to point out the way to one who is lost, or to set out a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes might see forms. I go to the Buddha for refuge, to the Dhamma, & to the community of monks. May Master Ananda remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for life."
Wishes|1|1| On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery. There he addressed the monks, "Monks!" "Yes, lord," the monks responded.
Wishes|1|2| The Blessed One said: "Monks, dwell consummate in virtue, consummate in terms of the Patimokkha. Dwell restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha, consummate in your behavior and sphere of activity. Train yourselves, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the slightest faults. [1] "If a monk would wish, 'May I be dear and pleasing to my fellows in the holy life, respected by and inspiring to them,' then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to mental calm, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings. [2] "If a monk would wish, 'May I be someone who receives robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medical requisites for curing the sick,' then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to mental calm, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings. [3] "If a monk would wish, 'Whatever I use or consume in terms of robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medical requisites for curing the sick, may that be of great fruit, of great benefit to those who provided them,' then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to mental calm, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings. [4] "If a monk would wish, 'May it also be of great fruit, of great benefit, to whatever dead relatives they [the donors] recollect with brightened minds,' then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to mental calm, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings. [5] "If a monk would wish, 'May I be content with whatever robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medical requisites for curing the sick are available,' then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to mental calm, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings. [6] "If a monk would wish, 'May I be resistant to cold, heat, hunger, and thirst; to the touch of gadflies and mosquitoes, wind and sun and creeping things; to abusive, hurtful language; to bodily feelings that, when they arise, are painful, sharp, stabbing, fierce, distasteful, deadly,' then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to mental calm, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings. [7] "If a monk would wish, 'May I overcome displeasure, and not be overcome by displeasure. May I dwell having conquered any displeasure that has arisen,' then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to mental calm, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings. [8] "If a monk would wish, 'May I overcome fear and dread, and not be overcome by fear and dread. May I dwell having conquered any fear and dread that have arisen,' then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to mental calm, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings. [9] "If a monk would wish, 'May I attain -- whenever I want, without strain, without difficulty -- the four jhanas that are heightened mental states, pleasant abiding in the here-and-now,' then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to mental calm, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings. [10] "If a monk would wish, 'May I -- with the ending of mental fermentations -- remain in the fermentation-free release of awareness and release of discernment, having directly known and realized them for myself in the here-and-now,' then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to mental calm, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings.
Wishes|1|3| "'Monks, dwell consummate in virtue, consummate in terms of the Patimokkha. Dwell restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha, consummate in your behavior and sphere of activity. Train yourselves, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the slightest faults.' Thus was it said and in reference to this was it said."
If a Monk Should Wish|1|1| Thus have I heard: On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove. There he addressed the monks: "monks, live lives filled with virtue, model your behavior upon the Patimokkha (Monastic code of discipline), and you will be perfect in conduct and filled with fear at the slightest fault. Therefore, train your mind by following the (Monastic) Precepts. If a monk should wish: ‘may I be loved and befriended by my companions in the holy life, may I be respected and honored by them.’ If this is so, let him live by the Precepts, achieve serenity of mind, practice daily to develop insight and dwell in seclusion—this is the law by which he should live.
If a Monk Should Wish|1|2| If a monk should wish: ‘may I acquire sufficient robes, alms-food, a clean, decent resting place, and even medical supplies when necessary,’ let him live by the law.
If a Monk Should Wish|1|3| If a monk should wish: ’may the services of those who grant to me robes, alms-food, a resting place and even medicinal supplies bring to them great merit and benefit’ then let him live by this law.
If a Monk Should Wish|1|4| If a monk should wish: ‘may my family, those that have died, profit from my behavior. May those of my family who still live, model themselves on my behavior, thereby earning vast merit and experiencing great benefit,’ then let him live by this law.
If a Monk Should Wish|1|5| If a monk should wish: ‘may I conquer unhappiness as well as delight, and may these emotions not conquer me,’ let him live by this law.
If a Monk Should Wish|1|6| If a monk should wish: ‘may I defeat fear and dismay, and may not fear and dismay conquer me,’ let him live by this law.
If a Monk Should Wish|1|7| If a monk should wish: ‘may I obtain the four mental absorptions that make-up the higher mind without great difficulty, so that I might dwell peacefully in the now,’ let him live by this law.
If a Monk Should Wish|1|8| ‘If a monk should wish: ‘may I attain those liberations that bring peace and lose all desire for material objects,’ let him live by this law.
If a Monk Should Wish|1|8| If a monk should wish: ‘may I destroy the three chains (1.the view of self, 2. doubts, 3. sensual desire and ill-will) that bind me to suffering and become a stream-enterer,’ let him live by this law.
If a Monk Should Wish|1|9| If a monk should wish: ‘may I, having destroyed these three chains and other mental impurities, attain to the stage of once-returner,’ let him live by this law.
If a Monk Should Wish|1|10| If a monk should wish: ‘may I attain re-birth in the Pure Land and there attain final Nirvana,’ let him live by this law.
If a Monk Should Wish|1|11| If a monk should wish: ‘may I exercise all super-normal powers to aid my teaching of other beings,’ let him live by this law.
If a Monk Should Wish|1|12| If a monk should wish: ‘may I develop the purified ear that allows me to hear both human and divine sounds,’ let him live by this law.
If a Monk Should Wish|1|13| If a monk should wish: ‘may I comprehend the minds of all the beings I encounter, may I recognize those whose minds are pure as well as impure,’ let him live by this law.
If a Monk Should Wish|1|14| If a monk should wish: ‘may I recall my numberless past lives,’ let him live by this law.
If a Monk Should Wish|1|15| If a monk should wish: ‘may I develop the pure eye that allows me to see and understand how beings are born and pass on according to their actions,’ let him live by this law.
If a Monk Should Wish|1|16| If a monk should wish: ‘may I, in this present moment, enter and abide in the freedom that comes from the destruction of all impurities,’ let him live by this law. That is what the Blessed One said and the monks were satisfied and took great pleasure in the Blessed One’s words.

Insult|1|1| I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. Then the Brahmin Akkosaka ("Insulter") Bharadvaja heard that a Brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan had gone forth from the home life into homelessness in the presence of the Blessed One. Angered and displeased, he went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, insulted and cursed him with rude, harsh words.
Insult|1|2| When this was said, the Blessed One said to him: "What do you think, Brahmin: Do friends and colleagues, relatives and kinsmen come to you as guests?"  "Yes, Master Gautama, sometimes friends and colleagues, relatives and kinsmen come to me as guests."  "And what do you think: Do you serve them with staple and non-staple foods and delicacies?"  "Yes, sometimes I serve them with staple and non-staple foods and delicacies."  "And if they don't accept them, to whom do those foods belong?"  "If they don't accept them, Master Gautama, those foods are all mine." 
Insult|1|3| "In the same way, Brahmin, that with which you have insulted me, who is not insulting; that with which you have taunted me, who is not taunting; that with which you have berated me, who is not berating: that I don't accept from you. It's all yours, Brahmin. It's all yours.  "Whoever returns insult to one who is insulting, returns taunts to one who is taunting, returns a berating to one who is berating, is said to be eating together, sharing company, with that person. But I am neither eating together nor sharing your company, Brahmin. It's all yours. It's all yours."  "The king together with his court know this of Master Gautama -- 'Gautama the contemplative is an arhat' -- and yet still Master Gautama gets angry."
Insult|1|4| Whence is there anger for one free from anger,  tamed,  living in tune -- one released through right knowing, calmed  and Such. You make things worse when you flare up at someone who's angry. Whoever doesn't flare up at someone who's angry wins a battle  hard to win. You live for the good of both     -- your own, the other's -- when, knowing the other's provoked, you mindfully grow calm. When you work the cure of both     -- your own, the other's -- those who think you a fool know nothing of Dhamma.  
Insult|1|5| When this was said, the Brahmin Akkosaka Bharadvaja said to the Blessed One, "Magnificent, Master Gautama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what had been overturned, were to reveal what was hidden, were to show the way to one who was lost, or were to hold up a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way Master Gautama has -- through many lines of reasoning -- made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the community of monks. Let me obtain the going forth in Master Gautama’s presence, let me obtain admission." 
Insult|1|6| Then the Brahmin Akkosaka Bharadvaja received the going forth and the admission in the Blessed One's presence. And not long after his admission -- dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, and resolute -- he in no long time reached and remained in the supreme goal of the holy life, for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing and realizing it for himself in the here and now. He knew: "Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world." And so Ven. Bharadvaja became another one of the Arhats. 
The Simile of the Snake|1|1| Thus I heard: At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anathapindika in Jeta’s grove in Savatthi. At that time to a Bhikkhu named Arittha, a vulture trainer in his previous birth, this evil view had arisen. As I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments. Then many Bhikkhus heard that this evil view had arisen to the Bhikkhu Arittha, a vulture trainer in his previous birth As I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments.
The Simile of the Snake|1|2| Then they approached the Bhikkhu Arittha and asked him: Friend Arittha is it true that such an evil view has arisen to you: As I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments. Yes, friends, as I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, to one who pursues those impedimental things declared, as impediments are not suitable impediments. Then those Bhikkhus thinking to dissuade the Bhikkhu Arittha from that evil view, cross questioned him, asked for reasons and discussed with him. Friend, Arittha do not say that, do not accuse the Blessed One. The Blessed One did not say that. The Blessed One has shown in various ways how these impedimental things are impediments to one who pursues them. The Blessed One has said that sensuality brings little satisfaction much unpleasantness and much trouble, there are many dangers there. The Blessed One has said that sensuality is comparable to a skeleton, a tendon of flesh, a burning grass torch, a pit full of burning charcoal, a dream, something borrowed, like a tree full of fruits, a slaughter house, the blade of a weapon, the head of a serpent. The Blessed One has said that sensuality brings much unpleasantness, much trouble and many dangers. Even when so much was told the Bhikkhu Arittha held on tenaciously to his view and would not give it up; as I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments
The Simile of the Snake|1|3| When the Bhikkhus could not dissuade the Bhikkhu Arittha from that evil view, they approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said thus: Venerable sir, to a Bhikkhu named Arittha, a vulture trainer in his previous birth, this evil view had arisen. As I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments. Then many of us heard that this evil view had arisen to the Bhikkhu Arittha, a vulture trainer in his previous birth As I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments.
The Simile of the Snake|1|4| Then we approached the Bhikkhu Arittha and asked him : Friend Arittha is it true that such an evil view has arisen to you: As I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments. He said, yes, friends, as I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments. Then we Bhikkhus thinking to dissuade the Bhikkhu Arittha from that evil view, cross questioned him, asked for reasons and discussed with him. Friend, Arittha do not say that, do not accuse the Blessed One. The Blessed One did not say that. The Blessed One has shown in various ways how these impedimental things are impediments to one who pursues them. The Blessed One has said that sensuality brings little satisfaction much unpleasantness and much trouble, there are many dangers there. The Blessed One has said that sensuality is comparable to a skeleton, a tendon of flesh, a burning grass torch, a pitfull of burning charcoal, a dream, something borrowed, like a tree full of fruits, a slaughter house, the blade of a weapon, the head of a serpent. The Blessed One has said that sensuality brings much unpleasantness, much trouble and many dangers. Even when so much was told the Bhikkhu Arittha held on tenaciously to his view and would not give it up; as I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments As we could not dissuade the Bhikkhu Arittha from that evil view, we came to inform you about it.
The Simile of the Snake|1|5| Then the Blessed One addressed a certain Bhikkhu and said, Come Bhikkhu, in my words call the Bhikkhu Arittha, tell, the Teacher wants him. That Bhikkhu consenting approached the Bhikkhu Arittha and told him, Friend, the Teacher wants you.. The Bhikkhu Arittha saying yes, friend, approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side. Then the Blessed One said, Arittha, is it true, that such a view has arisen to you, As I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments, are not suitable impediments. Then he said, yes, venerable sir, as I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, to one who pursues those impedimental things, declared as impediments, are not suitable impediments.- Foolish man, to whom do you know me teaching this. Haven’t I in many ways told that the impedimental things are impediments, indeed to one who pursues them they are impediments. I have told that sensuality brings little satisfaction, much un-pleasantness and trouble, the dangers here are many. - I have told that sensuality is comparable to a skeleton, a tendon of flesh, a burning grass torch, a pit of burning charcoal, a dream, something borrowed, a tree full of fruits, the blade of a weapon, the head of a serpent, I have told it has much unpleasantness, much trouble and the dangers there are many. Yet you foolish man, on account of your wrong view you accuse me and destroy yourself and accumulate much demerit, which will be for your unpleasantness for a long time. Then the Blessed One addressed :Bhikkhus, what do you think, shouldn’t we chastise this Bhikkhu Arittha, a vulture trainer in his earlier birth from this dispensation When this was said the Bhikkhu Arittha a vulture trainer in his earlier birth became silent, and unable to reply back, with a drooping form sat with eyes turned down. Then the Blessed One knowing that the Bhikkhu Arittha a vulture trainer in his earlier birth has become silent, unable to reply back, with a drooping form sitting with eyes turned down told him, foolish man, you will be pointed out on account of this evil view, now I will question the Bhikkhus on this
The Simile of the Snake|1|6| Then the Blessed One addressed the Bhikkhus; Bhikkhus, do you too know of this Teaching, the wrong view of the Bhikkhu Arittha, a vulture trainer in his earlier birth on account of which he brings blame on us and also destroys himself and accumulates much unpleasantness. -No venerable sir, The impedimental things are told by the Blessed One and indeed to one who pursues them, they are impediments. The Blessed One has said that there is little satisfaction in sensuality, much unpleasantness and much trouble, the dangers there are many. The Blessed One has said that sensuality is comparable to a skeleton, a tendon of flesh, a burning grass torch, a pit of burning charcoal, a dream, something borrowed, a tree full of fruits, the blade of a weapon, and the head of a serpent. The Blessed On has said it has much unpleasantness, much trouble and the dangers there are many.. Good! Bhikkhus, Good, that you know the Teaching taught by me. In various ways I have shown the impedimental things and indeed it is impedimental to pursues them. I have told that sensuality brings little satisfaction, much unpleasantness and the dangers there are many. I have told it is comparable to skeleton--to the head of a serpent brings little satisfaction, much unpleasantness and the dangers there are many. Yet the Bhikkhu Arittha holding to this wrong view blames us and destroys himself and accumulates much demerit, and it will be for his unpleasantness for a long time.
The Simile of the Snake|1|7| Bhikkhus, someone could indulge in sensuality, without sensual perceptions, without sensual thoughts is not possible Bhikkhus, a certain foolish man learns the prose sections, prose and verse sections, the answers and explanation expositions, stanzas, solemn utterances, thus said sections, birth stories, wonderful things, a series of questions and answers. He thoroughly learns the Teaching but does not examine the meanings with wisdom. So he cannot take pleasure in the Teaching. He learns the Teaching for the purpose of finding fault. He takes a wrong grasp of the Teaching and that conduces for his unpleasantness for a long time. The reason is the wrong grasp of the Teaching. Like a man wandering in search of a serpent would come to a huge serpent, he would take hold of the serpent by the hood or the tail and it would turn round and sting the hand or foot or any other limb. On account of this wrong grasp of the serpent he would meet death or deadly unpleasantness. In the same manner a certain foolish man learns the prose sections, prose and verse sections, the answers and explanation expositions, stanzas, solemn utterances, thus said sections, birth stories, wonderful things, a series of questions and answers. He thoroughly learns the Teaching but does not examine the meanings with wisdom. So he cannot take pleasure in the Teaching. He learns the Teaching for the purpose of finding fault. He takes a wrong grasp of the Teaching and that conduces for his unpleasantness for a long time. The reason is the wrong grasp of the Teaching.
The Simile of the Snake|1|8| Bhikkhus, a certain son of a clansman learns the prose sections, prose and verse sections, the answers and explanation expositions, stanzas, solemn utterances, thus said sections, birth stories, wonderful things, a series of questions and answers. He thoroughly learns the Teaching and examines the meanings with wisdom and is convinced of the Teaching. He does not learn the Teaching to find fault with it, nor does he learn it for the purpose of release through hearsay. He experiences the meanings. He has taken hold of the Teaching correctly, and it conduces for his pleasantness for a long time. It is because of the correct grasp of the Teaching. Like a man wandering in search of a serpent would come to a huge serpent and would take hold of it with a forked stick or hold it by the neck, it may coil round the man’s hand or foot or any other limb small or large, yet he would not come to death or deadly unpleasantness, because of the correct hold of the snake. In the same manner, a certain son of a clansman learns the prose sections, prose and verse sections, the answers and explanation expositions, stanzas, solemn utterances, thus said sections, birth stories, wonderful things, a series of questions and answers.

The Simile of the Snake|1|9| Bhikkhus, this Teaching is for giving up not for taking hold of, listen to it carefully. Like a man come to the highway would see a large stretch of water, the hither shore dangerous and fearful, the thither shore peaceful and without fear. There is no ship or overhead bridge to cross over from the hither shore to the thither. What if I build a raft collecting grass, sticks, branches and creepers. So he built a raft collecting grass sticks branches and creepers, and making effort with hands and feet reached the other shore safely. Then to the one who has crossed over this thought occurred This raft was of great service to me, I safely crossed over to the other shore boarding it and putting forth effort with my hands and feet. What if I balance it on my head or haul it on my back and go where I like. Bhikkhus, is he doing the right thing if he does so with the raft.- Doing what will he be doing the right thing with the raft.. Bhikkhus, to the man who has crossed over it occurs thus: This raft was of great service to me, I safely crossed over to the other shore boarding it and putting forth effort with my hands and feet. What if I pulled it up to dry ground , or sink it in the water and go where I like. A man doing that would be doing the right thing. Just so, Bhikkhus, my Teaching is comparable to a raft for the purpose of crossing over and not for getting hold of. You should give up even the Teaching that should be known, and what about that which should not be known...
The Simile of the Snake|1|10| Bhikkhus, these six are the views. What six. Bhikkhus, the ordinary man who has not seen the noble ones and Great Beings, not clever in their Teaching, and not trained in their Teaching Sees matter: that is me, I am that, that is my self. Sees feelings,; that is me, I am that, that is my self. Sees determinations: that is me, I am that, that is my self. Whatever seen, heard, tasted, smelt and bodily felt, cognized, attained, sought after, and reflected in the mind: that is me, I am that, that is my self The world, the self, I will be in the future, permanent, not changing, an eternal thing.; that is me, I am that, that is my self. Bhikkhus, the learned noble disciple, who has seen noble ones and Great Beings, clever in their Teaching, and trained in their Teaching sees matter: that is not me, am not that, that is not my self. Sees feelings: that is not me ,am not that, that is not my self. Sees determinations: that is not me am not that, that is not my self, Whatever seen, heard, tasted, smelt, bodily felt, cognized, attained, sought after, and reflected in the mind: that is not me, am not that, that is not my self. The world, the self, I will be in the future, permanent, not changing, an eternal thing, that is not me, am not that, that is not my self.. Seeing it is not present, is not excited. . When this was said, a certain Bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: Venerable sir, is there excitement for external non presence. The Blessed One said, there is Bhikkhu. Here, Bhikkhu, it occurs to someone thus: There was to me, now it is not to me, I had, now I do not gain, he grieves, laments and beats the breast and comes to bewilderment of mind. Thus there is excitement for external non-presence. - Venerable sir, is there non-excitement for external non-presence. The Blessed One said, there is Bhikkhu. Here, Bhikkhu, it does not occur to someone: There was to me, now it is not to me, I had, now I do not gain, he does not grieve or lament, does not beat the breast and come to bewilderment of mind. Thus there is no excitement for external non-presence. -Venerable sir, is there excitement for internal non-presence: The Blessed One said, there is Bhikkhu. Here, Bhikkhu, to a certain one there is this view. The world, the self, I will be in the future, permanent, not changing, an eternal thing. Then he hears this Teaching from the Thus Gone One or from a disciple of the Thus Gone One for the complete abolishment of views, determinant resolutions, prepossessions, latent tendencies for settlements, for the appeasement of all determinations, for the giving up of all endearments, for the destruction of craving, for non attachment, cessation and extinction. Then it occurs to him, indeed it will be my annihilation, my destruction, I will not be. He grieves, laments, beats the breast and comes to bewilderment of mind. Thus, there is excitement for internal non-presence. Venerable sir, is there non-excitement for internal non-presence.
The Simile of the Snake|1|11| There is Bhikkhu, said the Blessed One: Here Bhikkhu. to a certain one there is not this view.

Then it does not occur to him, indeed it will be my annihilation, my destruction, I will not be. He does not grieve, lament, beat the breast and come to bewilderment of mind. Thus, there is non-excitement for internal non-presence. Thus there is non-excitement for internal non-presence.
The Simile of the Snake|1|12| Bhikkhus, do you see anything permanent, not changing, eternal, to seize. No, venerable sir. Good! I too do not see anything to seize that which is permanent, not changing, and stands eternity. Bhikkhus, is there the holding of a self view which does not give birth to grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress. No, venerable sir. Good! I too do not see a self view which does not give birth to grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress. Bhikkhus is there a settled view which does not give birth to grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress. No, venerable sir. Good! I too do not see a settled view which does not give birth to grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress.
The Simile of the Snake|1|13| Bhikkhus, when there are belongings of a self, is there a satisfaction, these are mine. Yes, venerable sir.. A self or the belongings of a self, in reality and truth cannot be gained. Bhikkhus, this settled view, about the world, and the self, I will be in the future, permanent, not changing, standing eternity, isn’t it a completely foolish notion- Why isn’t it, venerable sir, it is a completely foolish notion- What do you think:-- Is matter permanent or impermanent.-- Impermanent, venerable sir.-- That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant.-- -Unpleasant venerable sir. --That which is impermanent, unpleasant, a changing thing is it good to be considered that is me, that I am that is my self. -- No, venerable sir.-- Is feeling permanent or impermanent.-- Impermanent, venerable sir.-- That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant.-- -Unpleasant venerable sir. --That which is impermanent, unpleasant, a changing thing is it good to be considered that is me, that I am, that is my self.-- No, venerable sir --Are perceptions permanent or impermanent.-- Impermanent, venerable sir.-- That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant.-- -Unpleasant venerable sir. --That which is impermanent, unpleasant, a changing thing is it good to be considered that is me, that I am, that is my self.-- No, venerable sir.- -Are determinations permanent or impermanent.-- Impermanent, venerable sir.-- That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant.-- -Unpleasant venerable sir. --That which is impermanent, unpleasant, a changing thing is it good to be considered that is me, that I am, that is my self.-- No, venerable sir. --Is consciousness permanent or impermanent.-- Impermanent, venerable sir.-- That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant.-- -Unpleasant venerable sir. --That which is impermanent, unpleasant, a changing thing is it good to be considered that is me, that I am, that is my self.-- No, venerable sir. -- Therefore Bhikkhus, whatever matter, in the past, future or present, internal or external, exalted or un-exalted, far or near, all matter is not me, that am not, that is not my self- should be realized as it really is, with right wisdom. Whatever feelings-- whatever perceptions, --whatever determinations--whatever consciousness, in the past, future or present, internal or external, exalted or un-exalted, far or near, all consciousness is not me, that am not, that is not my self, should be realized as it really is, with right wisdom.
The Simile of the Snake|1|14| The learned noble disciple seeing thus detaches from matter, detaches from feelings, detaches from perceptions, detaches from determinations, detaches from consciousness. Detached is released. Released knowledge arises am released. Birth destroyed, the holy life lived to the end, what should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish for, he knows. To this is called removing the obstacle, filling the trenches, pulling out desires, seeing results, the noble one puts down the flag and is unyoked Bhikkhus, how does the Bhikkhu remove the obstacle; Here the Bhikkhus ignorance is dispelled, pulled out from the roots, and made a palm stump of it, so that it may not rise again. Thus the obstacle is removed. How does the Bhikkhu fill up the trenches; Here the Bhikkhu dispels the recurring births, making a palm stump of it so that it may not rise again. Thus the Bhikkhu fills up the trenches. How does the Bhikkhu pull out desires. Here the Bhikkhu dispels greed, together with the roots, makes it a palm stump, so that it may not rise again. Thus the Bhikkhu pulls out desires. How does the Bhikkhu see results. Here the Bhikkhu dispels the bonds to the sensual world, cuts them up completely, so that they may not rise again. Thus the Bhikkhu sees results. How does the noble one put down the flag and unyoke. Here the Bhikkhu dispels the conceit ‘I be’ pulling it out from the roots makes a palm stump of it, so that it may not rise again. Thus the Bhikkhu puts down the flag and unyokes.
The Simile of the Snake|1|15| Bhikkhus, if that released mind of the Bhikkhu was to be searched by Inda, Brahma, Pajapati and their retinue, it would not be found; thus unsupported is the consciousness of the Thus Gone One. What is the reason: I say that the Thus Gone One cannot be found even here and now. To me who says thus and preaches thus, certain recluses and Brahmins ingenuinely, untruthfully blame, the recluse Gotama the discipliner, purposefully shows the annihilation, destruction, and non evidence of beings. Bhikkhus, whatever I am not, that I do not proclaim, as a result these good recluses and Brahmins ingenuinely, untruthfully blame, the recluse Gotama the discipliner purposefully shows the annihilation, destruction and non-evidence of beings. Earlier and now also I declare -Unpleasant and its cessation. Others abuse, blame and annoy the Thus Gone One, for that the Thus Gone One has no ill feeling , aversion or discontent .Some others honor, revere and worship the Thus Gone One, for that the Thus Gone One has no blissful pleasurable joy. When others honor, revere and worship the Thus Gone One, it occurs to him, it is on account of what I have thoroughly understood that they do it. Bhikkhus, when others abuse, blame and annoy you, ill feeling, aversion and discontent should not be to you. Again Bhikkhus, when others honor, revere and worship you, a blissful pleasurable joy should not be to you. It should occur to you, it is on account of what I have thoroughly understood, that they do it..
The Simile of the Snake|1|16| Therefore Bhikkhus, if people carry away, burn or do what they like to grass-sticks-branches-creepers in this same Jeta’s grove, would it occur to you; People are carrying away, burning and doing what they like to us-- No, venerable sir.- What is the reason: Venerable sir, they are not our selves or the belongings of ourselves. -- Bhikkhus, in the same manner, whatever is not yours, dispel it., for your good welfare and pleasantness for a long time. Bhikkhus, what is not yours. Matter is not yours, dispel it for your good, welfare and pleasantness for a long time. Feeling is not yours, dispel it for your good, welfare and pleasantness for a long time. Perception is not yours, dispel it for your good, welfare and pleasantness for a long time. Determinations are not yours, dispel it for your good, welfare and pleasantness for a long time. Consciousness is not yours, dispel it for your good welfare and pleasantness for a long time.
The Simile of the Snake|1|17| Bhikkhus, my Teaching is well proclaimed, made manifest, open and threadbare Those Bhikkhus, who have perfected, destroyed desires, lived the holy life, done what should be done, put down the weight, attained to the highest good, destroyed the bonds of being, and released rightfully knowing , they have no further proceeding to show them. My Teaching is so well proclaimed, made manifest, open and threadbare
The Simile of the Snake|1|18| Those Bhikkhus who have dispelled the five lower fetters, they all arise spontaneously, and extinguish there itself, do not proceed from that world. My Teaching is so well proclaimed, made manifest, open and threadbare. Those Bhikkhus, who have dispelled the three fetters and diminishing greed, hate and delusion, they all become once returners, coming only once more to this world, to make an end of un-pleasantness. My Teaching is so well proclaimed, made manifest, open and threadbare. Those Bhikkhus who have dispelled the three fetters, all of them enter the stream of the Teaching, do not fall from there intending only extinction. My Teaching is so well proclaimed, made manifest, open and threadbare. Those who have some faith in me, some love for me they all are intent on heaven. The Blessed One said thus and those Bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One.

To the Alavaka Yakkha|1|8| Endowed with these four qualities,  truth,  self-control,  stamina,  relinquishment -- a householder of conviction, on passing away, doesn't grieve. 
To the Alavaka Yakkha|1|9| Now, go ask others,  common priests & contemplatives,  if anything better than  truth,  self-control,  endurance,     & relinquishment here can be found. 
To the Alavaka Yakkha|1|10| How could I go ask common priests & contemplatives? -- now that today I understand     what benefits     the next life. It was truly for my well-being that the Awakened One came     to stay in Alavi. Today I understand where what is given bears great fruit.  I will wander from village to village,  town to town,  paying homage to the Self-awakened One & the true rightness of the Dhamma. 
All the Taints|1|1|  I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery. There he addressed the monks: "Monks!" "Yes, lord," the monks replied.
All the Taints|1|2| The Blessed One said, "Monks, the ending of the fermentations is for one who knows and sees, I tell you, not for one who does not know and does not see. For one who knows what and sees what? Appropriate attention and inappropriate attention. When a monk attends inappropriately, un-arisen fermentations arise, and arisen fermentations increase. When a monk attends appropriately, un-arisen fermentations do not arise, and arisen fermentations are abandoned. There are fermentations to be abandoned by seeing, those to be abandoned by restraining, those to be abandoned by using, those to be abandoned by tolerating, those to be abandoned by avoiding, those to be abandoned by destroying, and those to be abandoned by developing.
All the Taints|1|3| "[1] And what are the fermentations to be abandoned by seeing? There is the case where an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person -- who has no regard for noble ones, is not well-versed or disciplined in their Dhamma; who has no regard for men of integrity, is not well-versed or disciplined in their Dhamma -- does not discern what ideas are fit for attention or what ideas are unfit for attention. This being so, he does not attend to ideas fit for attention and attends [instead] to ideas unfit for attention.
All the Taints|1|4| "And what are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends to? Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the un-arisen fermentation of sensuality arises in him, and the arisen fermentation of sensuality increases; the un-arisen fermentation of becoming arises in him, and arisen fermentation of becoming increases; the un-arisen fermentation of ignorance arises in him, and the arisen fermentation of ignorance increases. These are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends to. "And what are the ideas fit for attention that he does not attend to? Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the un-arisen fermentation of sensuality does not arise in him, and the arisen fermentation of sensuality is abandoned; the un-arisen fermentation of becoming does not arise in him, and arisen fermentation of becoming is abandoned; the un-arisen fermentation of ignorance does not arise in him, and the arisen fermentation of ignorance is abandoned. These are the ideas fit for attention that he does not attend to. Through his attending to ideas unfit for attention and through his not attending to ideas fit for attention, both un-arisen fermentations arise in him, and arisen fermentations increase.
All the Taints|1|5| "This is how he attends inappropriately: 'Was I in the past? Was I not in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? Having been what, what was I in the past? Shall I be in the future? Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the future? How shall I be in the future? Having been what, what shall I be in the future?’ Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present: 'Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? Where has this being come from? Where is it bound?' "As he attends inappropriately in this way, one of six kinds of view arises in him: The view I have a self arises in him as true and established, or the view I have no self ...or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self ...or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive not-self ...or the view It is precisely by means of not-self that I perceive self arises in him as true and established, or else he has a view like this: This very self of mine -- the knower that is sensitive here and there to the ripening of good and bad actions -- is the self of mine that is constant, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change, and will endure as long as eternity. This is called a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views. Bound by a fetter of views, the uninstructed run-of-the-mill person is not freed from birth, aging, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair. He is not freed, I tell you, from suffering and stress.
All the Taints|1|6| "The well-instructed disciple of the noble ones -- who has regard for noble ones, is well-versed and disciplined in their Dhamma; who has regard for men of integrity, is well-versed and disciplined in their Dhamma -- discerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are unfit for attention. This being so, he does not attend to ideas unfit for attention and attends [instead] to ideas fit for attention.
All the Taints|1|7| "And what are the ideas unfit for attention that he does not attend to? Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the un-arisen fermentation of sensuality arises in him, and the arisen fermentation of sensuality increases; the un-arisen fermentation of becoming arises in him, and arisen fermentation of becoming increases; the un-arisen fermentation of ignorance arises in him, and the arisen fermentation of ignorance increases. These are the ideas unfit for attention that he does not attends to.
All the Taints|1|8| "And what are the ideas fit for attention that he does attend to? Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the un-arisen fermentation of sensuality does not arise in him, and the arisen fermentation of sensuality is abandoned; the un-arisen fermentation of becoming does not arise in him, and the arisen fermentation of becoming is abandoned; the un-arisen fermentation of ignorance does not arise in him, and the arisen fermentation of ignorance is abandoned. These are the ideas fit for attention that he does attend to. Through his not attending to ideas unfit for attention and through his attending to ideas fit for attention, un-arisen fermentations do not arise in him, and arisen fermentations are abandoned.
All the Taints|1|9| "He attends appropriately, this is stress...This is the origination of stress...This is the cessation of stress...This is the way leading to the cessation of stress. As he attends appropriately in this way, three fetters are abandoned in him: identity-view, doubt, and grasping at precepts and practices. These are called the fermentations to be abandoned by seeing.
All the Taints|1|10| "[2] And what are the fermentations to be abandoned by restraining? There is the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, dwells restrained with the restraint of the eye-faculty. The fermentations, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were to dwell unrestrained with the restraint of the eye-faculty do not arise for him when he dwells restrained with the restraint of the eye-faculty.
All the Taints|1|10| Reflecting appropriately, he dwells restrained with the restraint of the ear-faculty...
All the Taints|1|11| Reflecting appropriately, he dwells restrained with the restraint of the nose-faculty...
All the Taints|1|12| Reflecting appropriately, he dwells restrained with the restraint of the tongue-faculty...
All the Taints|1|13| Reflecting appropriately, he dwells restrained with the restraint of the body-faculty...
All the Taints|1|14| Reflecting appropriately, he dwells restrained with the restraint of the intellect-faculty. The fermentations, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were to dwell unrestrained with the restraint of the intellect-faculty do not arise for him when he dwells restrained with the restraint of the intellect-faculty. These are called the fermentations to be abandoned by restraining.
All the Taints|1|15| "[3] And what are the fermentations to be abandoned by using? There is the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, uses the robe simply to counteract cold, to counteract heat, to counteract the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; simply for the purpose of covering the parts of the body that cause shame.
All the Taints|1|16| "Reflecting appropriately, he uses alms food, not playfully, nor for intoxication, nor for putting on bulk, nor for beautification; but simply for the survival and continuance of this body, for ending its afflictions, for the support of the holy life, thinking, 'Thus will I destroy old feelings [of hunger] and not create new feelings [from overeating]. I will maintain myself, be blameless, and live in comfort.'
All the Taints|1|17| "Reflecting appropriately, he uses lodging simply to counteract cold, to counteract heat, to counteract the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; simply for protection from the inclemency’s of weather and for the enjoyment of seclusion.
All the Taints|1|18| "Reflecting appropriately, he uses medicinal requisites that are used for curing the sick simply to counteract any pains of illness that have arisen and for maximum freedom from disease.
All the Taints|1|19| "The fermentations, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were not to use these things [in this way] do not arise for him when he uses them [in this way]. These are called the fermentations to be abandoned by using.
All the Taints|1|20| "And what are the fermentations to be abandoned by tolerating? There is the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, endures. He tolerates cold, heat, hunger, and thirst; the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; ill-spoken, unwelcome words and bodily feelings that, when they arise, are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, disagreeable, displeasing, and menacing to life. The fermentations, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were not to tolerate these things do not arise for him when he tolerates them. These are called the fermentations to be abandoned by tolerating.
All the Taints|1|21| "[5] And what are the fermentations to be abandoned by avoiding? There is the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, avoids a wild elephant, a wild horse, a wild bull, a wild dog, a snake, a stump, a bramble patch, a chasm, a cliff, a cesspool, and an open sewer. Reflecting appropriately, he avoids sitting in the sorts of unsuitable seats, wandering to the sorts of unsuitable habitats, and associating with the sorts of bad friends that would make his knowledgeable friends in the holy life suspect him of evil conduct. The fermentations, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were not to avoid these things do not arise for him when he avoids them. These are called the fermentations to be abandoned by avoiding.
All the Taints|1|22| "[6] And what are the fermentations to be abandoned by destroying? There is the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, does not tolerate an arisen thought of sensuality. He abandons it, destroys it, dispels it, and wipes it out of existence.
All the Taints|1|23| Reflecting appropriately, he does not tolerate an arisen thought of ill will ...
All the Taints|1|24| Reflecting appropriately, he does not tolerate an arisen thought of cruelty...
All the Taints|1|25| Reflecting appropriately, he does not tolerate arisen evil, unskillful mental qualities. He abandons them, destroys them, dispels them, and wipes them out of existence. The fermentations, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were not to destroy these things do not arise for him when he destroys them. These are called the fermentations to be abandoned by destroying.
All the Taints|1|26| "[7] And what are the fermentations to be abandoned by developing? There is the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, develops mindfulness as a factor of awakening dependent on seclusion...dispassion...cessation, resulting in letting go. He develops analysis of qualities as a factor of awakening...persistence as a factor of awakening...rapture as a factor of awakening...serenity as a factor of awakening...concentration as a factor of awakening...equanimity as a factor of awakening dependent on seclusion...dispassion...cessation, resulting in letting go. The fermentations, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were not to develop these qualities do not arise for him when he develops them. These are called the fermentations to be abandoned by developing.
All the Taints|1|27| "When a monk's fermentations that should be abandoned by seeing have been abandoned by seeing, his fermentations that should be abandoned by restraining have been abandoned by restraining, his fermentations that should be abandoned by using have been abandoned by using, his fermentations that should be abandoned by tolerating have been abandoned by tolerating, his fermentations that should be abandoned by avoiding have been abandoned by avoiding, his fermentations that should be abandoned by destroying have been abandoned by destroying, his fermentations that should be abandoned by developing have been abandoned by developing, then he is called a monk who dwells restrained with the restraint of all the fermentations. He has severed craving, thrown off the fetters, and -- through the right penetration of conceit -- has made an end of suffering and stress." That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.
Advice to Venerable Rahula At Ambalatthika|1|1| I heard thus: At one time the Blessed One was living in the Squirrels’ Sanctuary in the bamboo grove in Rajagaha. At that time venerable Rahula lived in Ambalatthika. Then the Blessed One getting up from his seclusion in the evening approached venerable Rahula in Ambalatthika. Venerable Rahula saw the Blessed One coming in the distance, prepared a seat and administered water. The Blessed One sat on the prepared seat and washed his feet. Venerable Rahula too worshipped the Blessed One and sat on a side.
Advice to Venerable Rahula At Ambalatthika|1|2| Then the Blessed One retained a little water in the vessel and addressed venerable Rahula. ‘Rahula, do you see this little water left over in the vessel?’ ‘Yes, venerable sir.’ ‘So little is his recluse-ship, that has no shame, to tell lies, aware’ Then the Blessed One threw away that little bit of water and addressed venerable Rahula. ‘Rahula, did you see that little water thrown away?’ ‘Yes, venerable sir’ ‘Thus thrown away is the recluse-ship of one who has no shame, to tell lies with awareness’. Then the Blessed One turned that vessel upside down and addressed venerable Rahula ‘Rahula, do you see this vessel turned upside down?’ ‘Yes, venerable sir’ ‘Thus turned upside down is the recluse-ship of one who has no shame to tell lies with awareness’. Then the Blessed One put the vessel upright and addressed venerable Rahula. ‘Rahula, do you see this vessel empty and deserted?’ ‘Yes, venerable sir’ ‘So empty is the recluse-ship of one who has no shame to tell lies with awareness.
Advice to Venerable Rahula At Ambalatthika|1|3| Rahula, the king’s huge well trained tusker, gone to the battle field, would work with his fore feet, hind feet, the fore part of his body, the hind part of his body, the head, his ears, tusks and with his tail, while protecting his trunk. Then it occurs to the elephant driver: This kings’ elephant the huge tusker gone to the battle field works with his fore feet and hind feet, fore part of the body and hind part of the body, with head, ears, tusks and tail, while protecting its trunk. There is nothing more to do to him. Rahula, just as there is nothing the king’s huge tusker gone to the battle field could not do with is limbs large and small, in the same manner, there is nothing that could not be done by one who has no shame to tell lies with awareness. Therefore you should train, I will not tell lies even for play.
Advice to Venerable Rahula At Ambalatthika|1|4| Rahula, what is the purpose of a mirror?’ ‘Venerable sir, for the purpose of reflection.’ ‘Rahula in the same manner reflecting you should do bodily actions, reflecting you should do verbal actions, reflecting you should do mental actions.
Advice to Venerable Rahula At Ambalatthika|1|5| ‘Rahula, when a desire arises to do some bodily action, you should reflect. Doing this bodily action, will I be troubled, will others be troubled, will both be troubled. Is this bodily action demerit? Is it unpleasant? When reflecting if you know, ‘This bodily action will bring trouble to me, to others and to both it is demerit, it is unpleasant. If possible you should not do it. Rahula, when, reflecting, if you know, ‘This bodily action I desire to do, will not bring me, trouble, others trouble, nor trouble to either. It’s merit and brings pleasantness. Rahula, you should do such bodily actions. Even while doing that bodily action, you should reflect. Does this bodily action give me trouble, give others trouble or does it give trouble to either? Is it demerit? Is it unpleasant? Rahula, when reflecting if you know this bodily action is unpleasant, give up such bodily actions. If you know, ‘this bodily action does not give me, others or either, trouble. It is merit, and it brings pleasantness’, Then follow up that bodily action. Rahula, having done such actions too you should reflect. Did this bodily action cause me, others, or either, trouble? Was it demerit? Did it arouse unpleasantness? When reflecting if you know, this bodily action caused me and others, trouble, it isn’t merit, aroused unpleasantness. Then you should declare it to the Teacher or a wise co-associate in the holy life, manifest it and make amends for future restraint. Rahula, when reflecting, if you know, this bodily action did not cause me, others or either trouble. It was merit and pleasant. Then you should abide delighted pursuing such things of merit day and night..
Advice to Venerable Rahula At Ambalatthika|1|6| Rahula, when a desire arises to you to do some verbal action, you should reflect thus: Doing this verbal action, will I trouble my self, others or both? Is this verbal action demerit? Is it unpleasant? When reflecting if you know, this verbal action will bring me, others and both trouble it is demerit and unpleasant. If possible you should not do it. Rahula, when, reflecting, if you know. This verbal action, if done, would not trouble either, ‘It is merit and is pleasant. Then Rahula, you should do such verbal actions. Even while doing that verbal action, you should reflect, ‘Does this verbal action give me, others, or either, trouble? Is it demerit? Is it unpleasant?’ Rahula, if it is unpleasant, give up such verbal actions. If you know, ‘this verbal action does not bring me, others, or either, trouble. It is merit and is pleasant.’ Follow up such verbal actions. Rahula, having done such verbal actions too you should reflect, ‘Did this cause me, others, or either, trouble? Was it demerit? Was it unpleasant? When reflecting if you know, this verbal action caused me, others, and both, trouble. It is demerit, and unpleasant.’ It should be declared to the Teacher or a wise co-associate in the holy life, manifest it and make amends for future restraint. Rahula, when reflecting you know, ‘this verbal action did not cause me, others or either trouble. It was merit and it was pleasant. Then you should abide delighted pursuing such things of merit day and night.
Advice to Venerable Rahula At Ambalatthika|1|7| Rahula, when you desire to do some mental action, you should reflect, ‘In doing this mental action, will I trouble myself? Is it demerit? Is it unpleasant? When reflecting if you know, ‘this mental action will trouble me. It is demerit and unpleasant.’ Then, if possible you should not do it. Rahula, when reflecting if you know, ‘this mental action will not bring me trouble. It is merit and pleasant.’ Then Rahula, you should do such mental actions. Even while doing that mental action, you should reflect, ‘Does this mental action give me, others, trouble? Is it demerit and unpleasant?’ Rahula, if that is so, give up that mental action. If you know, ‘this mental action does not bring me, others trouble. It’s merit, and pleasant.’ Then follow it up. Having done such mental actions too you should reflect, ‘Did it cause me, others, trouble? Was it demerit? Was it unpleasant?’ When reflecting if you know, ‘this mental action caused me, others, trouble. It is demerit and unpleasant.’ Then you should be disgusted and loathe such mental actions. Rahula, when reflecting if you know, ‘this mental action did not cause me, others, trouble, it was merit and it was pleasant.’ Then you should pursue such things of merit day and night delightedly.
Advice to Venerable Rahula At Ambalatthika|1|8| Rahula, whoever recluses or Brahmins purified their bodily actions, verbal actions and mental actions in the past, did by reflecting. Whoever recluses or Brahmins will purify their bodily, verbal and mental actions in the future will do so reflecting. Whoever recluses or Brahmins purify their bodily, verbal, and mental actions at present do so reflecting. Therefore Rahula, you should train thus, ‘Reflecting I will purify my bodily, verbal and mental actions.’ The Blessed One said thus and venerable Rahula delighted in the words of the Blessed One.
Instructions to Rahula at Mango Stone|1|1| I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Rajagaha, at the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Feeding Ground. At that time Ven. Rahula [1] was staying at the Mango Stone. Then the Blessed One, arising from his seclusion in the late afternoon, went to where Ven. Rahula was staying at the Mango Stone. Ven. Rahula saw him coming from afar and, on seeing him, set out a seat and water for washing the feet. The Blessed One sat down on the seat set out and, having sat down, washed his feet. Ven. Rahula, bowing down to the Blessed One, sat down to one side.
Instructions to Rahula at Mango Stone|1|2| Then the Blessed One, having left a little bit of the remaining water in the water dipper, said to Ven. Rahula, "Rahula, do you see this little bit of remaining water left in the water dipper?" "Yes sir." "That's how little of a contemplative [2] there is in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie." Having tossed away the little bit of remaining water, the Blessed One said to Ven. Rahula, "Rahula, do you see how this little bit of remaining water is tossed away?" "Yes, sir." "Whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is tossed away just like that. Having turned the water dipper upside down, the Blessed One said to Ven. Rahula, "Rahula, do you see how this water dipper is turned upside down?" "Yes, sir." "Whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is turned upside down just like that." Having turned the water dipper right-side up, the Blessed One said to Ven. Rahula, "Rahula, do you see how empty and hollow this water dipper is?" "Yes, sir."
Instructions to Rahula at Mango Stone|1|3| "Whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is empty and hollow just like that. "Rahula, it's like a royal elephant: immense, pedigreed, accustomed to battles, its tusks like chariot poles. Having gone into battle, it uses its forefeet and hind feet, its forequarters and hindquarters, its head and ears and tusks and tail, but will simply hold back its trunk. The elephant trainer notices that and thinks, 'This royal elephant has not given up its life to the king.' But when the royal elephant... having gone into battle, uses its forefeet and hind feet, its forequarters and hindquarters, its head and ears and tusks and tail and his trunk, the trainer notices that and thinks, 'This royal elephant has given up its life to the king. There is nothing it will not do.'
Instructions to Rahula at Mango Stone|1|4| "The same holds true with anyone who feels no shame in telling a deliberate lie: There is no evil, I tell you, he will not do. Thus, Rahula, you should train yourself, 'I will not tell a deliberate lie even in jest.' "How do you construe this, Rahula: What is a mirror for?" "For reflection, sir." "In the same way, Rahula, bodily acts, verbal acts, and mental acts are to be done with repeated reflection. "Whenever you want to perform a bodily act, you should reflect on it: 'this bodily act I want to perform -- would it lead to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both? Is it an unskillful bodily act, with painful consequences, painful results?' If, on reflection, you know that it would lead to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both; it would be an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences, painful results, then any bodily act of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to do. But if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction... it would be a skillful bodily action with happy consequences, happy results, then any bodily act of that sort is fit for you to do.

Pride Humbled|1|1| Thus have I heard. Once the lord was touring Kosala with a large number of monks, some five hundred, and he came to a Kosalan Brahmin village called Icchanankala. And he stayed in the dense jungle of Icchanankala. At that time the Brahmin Pokkharasati was living at Ukkhattha, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which had been given to him by king Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal gift with royal powers.
Pride Humbled|1|2| And Pokkharasati heard say, "The ascetic Gotama, son of the Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan, is staying in the dense jungle of Icchanankala. And concerning that Blessed Lord a good report has been spread about, ‘This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully enlightened Buddha, perfected in knowledge and conduct, a well-farer, knower of the worlds, unequalled trainer of men to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, a Blessed Lord.’ He proclaims this world with its gods, Maras, Brahmas, the world of ascetics and Brahmins with its princes and people, having come to know it by his own knowledge. He teaches a Dhamma that is ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and he displays the fully perfected, thoroughly purified holy life. And indeed it is good to see such Arahants."
Pride Humbled|1|3| Now, at that time Pokkharasati had a pupil, the youth Ambattha, who was a student of the Vedas, who knew the mantras, perfected in the Three Vedas, a skilled expounder of the rules and rituals, the lore of sounds and meanings and, fifthly, oral tradition, complete in philosophy and the marks of a great man, admitted and accepted by his master in the Three Vedas with the words, "What I know, you know; what you know, I know." And Pokkharasati said to Ambattha, "Ambattha, my son, the ascetic Gotama, son of the Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan, is staying in the dense jungle of Icchanankala. And concerning that Blessed Lord a good report has been spread about, , "This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully enlightened Buddha, perfected in knowledge and conduct, a well-farer, knower of the worlds, unequalled trainer of men to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, a Blessed Lord.’ Now you go to see the ascetic Gotama and find out whether this report is correct or not, and whether the Reverend Gotama is as they say or not. In that way we shall put the Reverend Gotama to the test."
Pride Humbled|1|4| "Sir, how shall I find out whether the report is true, or whether the Reverend Gotama is as they say or not?" "According to the tradition of our Mantras, Ambattha, the great man who is possessed of the thirty two marks of a great man has only two courses open to him. If he lives the household life he will become a ruler, a wheel-turning righteous monarch of the law, conqueror of the four quarters, who has established the security of his realm and is possessed of the seven treasures. These are, The Wheel Treasure, the Elephant Treasure, the Horse Treasure, the Jewel Treasure, the Woman Treasure, the Householder Treasure, and, as a seventh, the Counselor Treasure. He has more than a thousand sons who are heroes, of heroic stature, conquerors of the hostile army. He dwells having conquered the sea-girt land without a stick or sword, by the law. But if he goes forth from the household life into homelessness, then he will become an Arahant, a fully enlightened Buddha, one who draws back the view from the world. And, Ambattha, I am the passer-on of the Mantras, and you are the receiver."
Pride Humbled|1|5| "Very good, sir" said Ambattha at Pokkharasati’s words, and he got up, passed by Pokkharasati with his right side, got into his chariot drawn by a mare and, accompanied by a number of young me, headed for the dense jungle of Icchanankala. He drove as far as the carriage would go, then alighted and continued on foot.
Pride Humbled|1|6| At that time a number of monks were walking up and down in the open air. Ambattha approached them and said, "Where is the Reverend Gotama to be found just now? We have come to see the Reverend Gotama."
Pride Humbled|1|7| The monks considered Ambattha and thought, "This is Ambattha, a youth of good family and a pupil of the distinguished Brahmin Pokkharasati. The Lord would not mind having a conversation with such a young man." And they said to Ambattha,
Pride Humbled|1|8| "That is his dwelling, with the door closed. Go quietly up to it, go on to the veranda without haste, cough, and knock on the bolt. The Lord will open the door to you."
Pride Humbled|1|8| Ambattha went up to the dwelling and onto the veranda, coughed, and knocked. The Lord opened the door, and Ambattha went it. The young men entered, exchanged courtesies with the Lord, and sat down to one side. But Ambattha walked up and down while the Lord sat there, uttered some vague words of politeness, and then stood so speaking before the seated lord. [That was considered very rude behavior]
Pride Humbled|1|9| And the Lord said to Ambattha, "Well now, Ambattha, would you behave like this if you were talking to venerable and learned Brahmins, teachers of teachers, as you do with me, walking and standing while I am sitting, and uttering vague words of politeness?"
Pride Humbled|1|10| "No, Reverend Gotama. A Brahmin should walk with a walking Brahmin, stand with a standing Brahmin, sit with a sitting Brahmin, sit with a sitting Brahmin, and lie down with a Brahmin who is lying down. But as for those shaven little ascetics, menials, black scourings from Brahmas foot, with them it is fitting to speak just as I do with the Reverend Gotama."
Pride Humbled|1|11| "But, Ambattha, you came here seeking something. Whatever it was you came for, you should listen attentively to hear about it. Ambattha, you have not perfected your training. Your conceit of being trained is due to nothing but inexperience."
Pride Humbled|1|12| But Ambattha was angry and displeased at being called untrained, and he turned on the Lord with curses and insults. Thinking, "The ascetic Gotama bears me ill-will" he said, "Reverend Gotama, the Sakyans are fierce, rough spoken, touchy and violent. Being of menial origin, being menials, they do not honor, respect, esteem, revere or pay homage to Brahmins. With regard to this it is not proper that they [behave in such a manner and] do not pay homage to Brahmins. [He is complaining that they do not honor the rigid "caste system" of India. –BIONA webmaster] This was the first time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of being menials.
Pride Humbled|1|13| "But, Ambattha, what have the Sakyans done to you?" "Reverend Gotama, once I went to Kapilavatthu on some business for my teacher, the Brahmin Pokkharasati, and I cam to the Sakyans meeting hall. And at that time a lot of Sakyans were sitting on high seats in their meeting hall, poking each other with their fingers, laughing and playing about together, and it seemed to me that they were just making fun of me, and no offered me a seat. With regard to this, it is not proper that they do not pay homage to the Brahmins." This was the second time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of being menials.
Pride Humbled|1|14| "But, Ambattha, even the quail, that little bird, can talk as she likes in her own nest. Kapilavatthu is the Sakyans home, Ambattha. They do not deserve censure for such a trifle." "Reverend Gotama, there are four castes: The Khattiyas, the Brahmins, the merchants and the artisans. And of these four castes, three – the Khattiyas, the merchants, and the artisans – are entirely subservient to the Brahmins." This was the third time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of being menials.
Pride Humbled|1|15| Then the Lord thought, "This young man goes too far is abusing the Sakyans. Suppose I were to ask after his clan name?" So he said, "Ambattha, what is your clan?" "I am a Kanhayan, Reverend Gotama."
Pride Humbled|1|16| "Ambattha, in former days, according to those who remember the ancestral lineage, the Sakyans were the masters, and you are descended from a slave girl of the Sakyans. For the Sakyans regard to king Okkaka, to whom his queen was dear and beloved, wishing to transfer the kingdom to her son, banished his elder brothers from the kingdom – Okkamukha, Karandu, Hatthiniya, and Sinipura. And these, being banished, made their home on the flank of the Himalayas beside a lotus pond where there was a growth of teak-trees. And for fear of contaminating their stock they cohabitated with their own sisters. Then King Okkaha asked his ministers and counselors, "Where are the princes living now?" And they told him. At this, King Okkaha exclaimed, "They are strong as Saka trees, these princes, they are real Sakyans!" And this how the Sakyans go their well-known name. And the king was the ancestor of the Sakyans.
Pride Humbled|1|17| "Now King Okkaha has a slave girl called Disa, who gave birth to a Kanha [dirty, black] child. The black thing, when it was born, exclaimed, "Wash me, mother! Bath me, mother! Deliver me from this dirt and I will bring you profit!" Because, Ambattha, just as people today use the term hobgoblin as a term of abuse, so in those days did they say Kanha. And they said, "As soon as he was born, he spoke! He is born a Kanha, a hobgoblin!" That is how, in former days according to those who remember the ancestral lineage, the Sakyans were the masters, and you are descended from a slave girl of the Sakyans."
Pride Humbled|1|18| On hearing this, the young men said, "Reverend Gotama, do not humiliate Ambattha too much with talk of his being descended from a slave girl: Ambattha is well born, of a good family, he is very learned, he is well-spoken, a scholar, well able to hold his own in this discussion with the Reverend Gotama!"
Pride Humbled|1|19| Then the Lord said to the young men, "If you consider that Ambattha is ill-born, not of good family, unlearned, ill-spoke, unable to hold his own in this discussion with the ascetic Gotama, then let Ambattha be silent, and you conduct this discussion with me. But if you think he is well born, of a good family, he is very learned, he is well-spoken, a scholar, able to hold his own, then you be quiet and let him discuss with me."
Pride Humbled|1|20| "Ambattha is well born, Reverend Gotama, of a good family, he is very learned, he is well-spoken, a scholar, able to hold his own. We shall be silent, he shall continue." Then the Lord said to Ambattha, "Ambattha, I have a fundamental question for you, which you will not like to answer. If you don’t answer, or if you evade the issue, if you keep silent or go away, your head will split into seven pieces. What do you think, Ambattha? Have you heard from old and venerable Brahmins, teachers of teachers, where the Kanhayans came from, or who was their ancestor?"
Pride Humbled|1|21| At this, Ambattha remained silent, and the lord said, "Answer me now, Ambattha, this is not the time for silence. Whoever, Ambattha, does not answer a fundamental question put to him by a Tathágata by the third asking has his head split into seven pieces." [This is a pre-Buddhist mythos that, as Rhys Davids observes, never comes to anything.]
Pride Humbled|1|22| And at that moment Vajrapani the Yaksha, [This god is also called "Indra." He is ready to make good on the mytho mentioned above. The old gods are supporting the new religion. Vajrapani also appears as a Bodhisattva in later Mahayana Sutras.] holding up a huge iron club, flaming, ablaze and glowing, up in the sky just above Ambattha was thinking, "If this young man does not answer a proper question put to him by the Blessed Lord by the third time of asking, I’ll split his head into seven pieces!" The Lord saw Vajrapani, and so did Ambattha. And at the sight, Ambattha was terrified and unnerved, his hairs stood on end, and he sought protection, shelter, and safety from the Lord. Crouching down close to the Lord, he said, "What did the Reverend Gotama say? May the Reverend Gotama repeat what he said!"
Pride Humbled|1|23| "What do you think, Ambattha? Have you heard from old and venerable Brahmins, teachers of teachers, where the Kanhayans came from, or who was their ancestor?" "Yes, I have heard it just as the Reverend Gotama said, that is where the Kanhayans came from, he was their ancestor"
Pride Humbled|1|24| Hearing this, the young men made a loud noise and clamor, "So Ambattha is ill-born, not of a good family, born of a slave girl of the Sakyans, and the Sakyans are Ambattha’s masters! We disparages the Ascetic Gotama, thinking he was not speaking the truth!"
Pride Humbled|1|25| Then the Lord thought, "It is too much, the way these young men humiliate Ambattha for being the ancestor of a slave girl. I must get him out of this." So he said to the young men, "Don’t disparage Ambattha too much for being the ancestor of a slave girl! That Kahna was a mighty sage [Known more commonly today as Krishna --BIONA Webmaster.] He went to the south country, learnt the mantras of the Brahmins there, and then went to King Okkaka and asked for his daughter Maddarupi. And Okkaka, furiously angry, exclaimed, "So this fellow, the son of a slave girl, wants my daughter!" And put an arrow to his bow. But he unable either to shoot to arrow or to withdraw it. Then the ministers and the counselors came together to the Sage Kanha and said, "Spare the King, Reverend Sir, spare the king!"
Pride Humbled|1|26| "The king will be safe, but if he looses the arrow downwards, the earth will quake as far as his kingdom extends." "Reverend Sir, Spare the king, spare the land!" "The king and the land will be safe, but if he looses the arrow upwards, as for as his realm extends the god will not let it rain for seven years. [According to Rhys Davids this is a Bluff, as the spell could only stop the discharge of an arrow.]
Pride Humbled|1|29| "Reverend Sir, spare the king, Spare the land, and may the god let it rain!" "The king and the land will be safe, and the god will let it rain, but if the king points the arrow at the crown prince, the prince will be completely safe."
Pride Humbled|1|30| "Then the Ministers exclaimed, "Let King Okkaka point the arrow at the crown prince, the prince will be perfectly safe!" The king did so and the prince was unharmed. Then king Okkaka, terrified and fearful of divine punishment gave away his daughter to Maddarupi. So, young men, do not disparage Ambattha too much for being the ancestor of a slave girl. That Kahna was a mighty sage."
Pride Humbled|1|31| Then the lord said, "Ambattha, what do you think? Suppose a Khattiya youth were to wed a Brahmin maiden, and there was a son of the union. Would that son of a Khattiya youth and a Brahmin maiden receive a seat and water from the Brahmins?" "He would, Reverend Gotama." "Would they allow him to eat at funeral-rites, at rice-offerings, at sacrifices, or as a guest?" "They would, Reverend Gotama." "Would they teach him mantras or not?" "They would, Reverend Gotama." "Would they keep their women covered or uncovered?" "Uncovered, Reverend Gotama." "But would the Khattiyas sprinkle him with the Khattiya consencration?" "No, Reverend Gotama." "Why not?" "Because, Reverend Gotama, he is not well born on his mothers side." "What do you think, Ambattha? Suppose a Brahmin youth were to wed a Khattiya maiden, and there was a son of the union. Would that son of a Khattiya youth and a Brahmin maiden receive a seat and water from the Brahmins?" "He would, Reverend Gotama." "He would, Reverend Gotama." "Would they allow him to eat at funeral-rites, at rice-offerings, at sacrifices, or as a guest?" "They would, Reverend Gotama." "Would they teach him mantras or not?" "They would, Reverend Gotama." "Would they keep their women covered or uncovered?" "Uncovered, Reverend Gotama." "But would the Khattiyas sprinkle him with the Khattiya consecration?" "No, Reverend Gotama." "Why not?" "Because, Reverend Gotama, he is not well born on his fathers side." "So, Ambattha, the Khattiyas, through a man taking a woman or a woman taking a man, are senior to the Brahmins. What do you think, Ambattha? Take the case of a Brahmin who, for some reason, has had his head shaved by the Brahmins, has been punished with a bag of ashes and banished from the country or the city.  Would he receive a seat and water from the Brahmins?"  "No, Reverend Gotama." "Would they allow him to eat at funeral-rites, at rice-offerings, at sacrifices, or as a guest?"  "No, Reverend Gotama." "Would they teach him mantras, or not?"  "They would not, Reverend Gotama." "Would they keep their women covered or uncovered?"  "Covered, Reverend Gotama." "What do you think, Ambattha?  Take the case of a Khattiya who, for some reason, had his head shaved by the Khattiyas, has been punished with a bag of ashes and banished from the country or the city.  Would he receive a seat and water from the Brahmins?"  "He would, Reverend Gotama." "Would they keep their women covered or uncovered?"  "Uncovered, Reverend Gotama." "But that Khattiya has so far reached the extreme of humiliation that he has … been banished from the country or the city.  So even if a Khattiya has suffered extreme humiliation, he is superior and the Brahmins inferior. "Ambittha, this verse was pronounced by Brahma Sanankumara: "The Khattiya’s best among those who value clan;  He with knowledge and conduct is best of Gods and men." "This verse was rightly sung, not wrongly, rightly spoken, not wrongly, connected with profit, not unconnected.  And, Ambattha, I too say this, "The Khattiya’s best among those who value clan:   He with knowledge and conduct is best of Gods and men."
Pride Humbled|2|1| "But, Reverend Gotama, what is this conduct, what is this knowledge?" "Ambattha, it is not from the standpoint of the attainment of unexcelled knowledge-and-conduct that reputation based on birth and clan is declared, nor on the conceit which says:  "You are worthy of me, you are not worthy of me!   For wherever there is a giving, a taking, or a giving and taking in marriage, there is always this talk and this conceit … But those who are enslaved by such things are far from the attainment of the unexcelled knowledge-and-conduct, which is attained by abandoning all such things!"
Pride Humbled|2|2| "But, Reverend Gotama, what is this conduct, what is this knowledge?" "Ambattha, a Tathágata arises in this world, an Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of Gods and humans, enlightened and blessed.  He, having realized it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world with its Devas, Maras and Brahmas, its princes and people.  He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life. A disciple goes forth and practices the moralities; he guards the sense-doors, etc.; attains the four jhanas. Thus he develops conduct.  He attains various insights, and the cessation of the corruptions…And beyond this there is no further development of knowledge and conduct that is higher or more perfect.
Pride Humbled|2|3| "But, Ambattha, in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct, there are four paths of failure.  What are they?  In the first place, an ascetic or Brahmin who has not managed to gain this unexcelled attainment, takes his carrying-pole and plunges into the depths of the forest thinking:  " I will live on windfalls."  But in this way he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained.  This is the first path of failure.  Again, an ascetic or Brahmin, being unable to live on windfalls, takes a spade and basket, thinking:  "I will live on tubers and roots."…This is the second path of failure.  Again, an ascetic or Brahmin, being unable to live on tubers and roots, makes a fire-hearth at the edge of a village or small town and sits tending the flame…This is the third path of failure.  Again, an ascetic or Brahmin, being unable to tend the flame, erects a house with four doors at the crossroads thinking:   "Whatever ascetic or Brahmin arrives from the four quarters, I will honor to the best of my strength and ability."  But in this way he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conduct.  This is the fourth path of failure.
Pride Humbled|2|4| "What do you think, Ambattha?  Do you and your teacher live in accordance with this unexcelled knowledge and conduct?"   "No indeed, Reverend Gotama!  Who are my teacher and I in comparison?  We are far from it!" "Well then, Ambattha, could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this, go with your carrying-poles into the depths of the forest, intending to live on windfalls?"  "No. Indeed, Reverend Gotama." "Well then, Ambattha, could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this, live on tubers and roots, … sit tending the flame, … erect a house …?"  "No, indeed, Reverend Gotama."
Pride Humbled|2|5| "And so, Ambattha, not only are you and your teacher incapable of attaining this unexcelled knowledge and conduct, but even the four paths of failure are beyond you.  And yet you and your teacher the Brahmin Pokkharasati utter these words:  "These shaven little ascetics, menials, black scrapings from Brahma’s foot, what converse can they have with Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas?" – even though you can’t even manage the duties of one who has failed.  See, Ambattha, how your teacher has let you down!" "Ambattha, the Brahmin Pokkharasati lives by the grace and favor of King Pasenadi of Kosala.  And yet the King does not allow him to have audience face to face.  When he confers with the King it is through a curtain.  Why should the King not grant audience face to face to one on whom he has bestowed a proper and blameless source of revenue?  See how your teacher has let you down!" "What do you think, Ambattha?  Suppose King Pasenadi was sitting on the neck of an elephant or on horseback, or was standing on the chariot-mat, conferring with his ministers and princes about something.  And suppose he were to step aside and some workman or workman’s servant were to come along and stand in his place.  And standing there he might say:  "This is what King Pasenadi of Kosala says!"   "Would he be speaking the King’s words, as if he were the King’s equal?"  "No, indeed, Reverend Gotama."
Pride Humbled|2|6| "Well then, Ambattha, it is just the same thing.  Those who were, as you say, the first sages of the Brahmins, the makers and expounders of the mantras, whose ancient verses are chanted, pronounced and collected by the Brahmins of today – Atthaka, Vamaka, Vamadeva, Vessamitta, Yamataggi, Angirasa, Bharadvaja, Vasettha, Kassapa, Bhagu 21  – whose mantras are said to be passed on to you and your teacher:  yet you do not thereby become a sage or one practised in the way of a sage – such a thing is not possible. "What do you think, Ambattha?  What have you heard said by Brahmins who are venerable, aged, the teachers of teachers?  Those first sages, Attaka, … Bhagu – did they enjoy themselves, well-bathed, perfumed, their hair and beards trimmed, adorned with garlands and wreaths, dressed in white clothes, indulging in the pleasures of the five senses and addicted to them, as you and your teacher do now?"  "No, Reverend Gotama." "Or did they eat special fine rice with the black spots removed, with various soups and curries, as you and your teacher do now?"  "No, Reverend Gotama." "Or did they amuse themselves with women dressed up in flounces and furbelows, as you and your teacher do now?"  "No, Reverend Gotama." "Or did they ride around in chariots drawn by mares with braided tails, that they urged on with long goad-sticks?"  "No, Reverend Gotama." "Or did they have themselves guarded in fortified towns with palisades and barricades, by men with long swords …?"  "No, Reverend Gotama." "So, Ambattha, neither you nor your teacher are a sage or one trained in the way of a sage.  And now, as for your doubts and perplexities concerning me, we will clarify these by your asking me, and by my answering your questions."
Pride Humbled|2|7| Then, descending from his lodging, the Lord started to walk up and down, and Ambattha did likewise.  And as he walked along with the Lord, Ambattha looked out for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Lord’s body.  And he could see all of them except for two.  He was in doubt and perplexity about two of these marks:  he could not make up his mind or be certain about the sheathed genitals or the large tongue. And the Lord, being aware of his doubts, effected by his psychic power that Ambattha could see his sheathed genitals, and then, sticking out his tongue, he reached out to lick both ears and both nostrils, and then covered the whole circle of his forehead with his tongue.  Then Ambattha thought: 
Pride Humbled|2|8| "The ascetic Gotama is equipped with all the thirty-two marks of a Great Man, complete and with none missing."   Then he said to the Lord:  "Reverend Gotama, may I go now?  I have much business, much to do."  "Ambattha, do what you now think fit."  So Ambattha got back into his chariot drawn by mares and departed.
Pride Humbled|2|9| Meanwhile the Brahmin Pokkharasati had gone outside and was sitting in his park with a large number of Brahmins, just waiting for Ambattha. Then Ambattha came to the park.  He rode in the chariot as far as it would go, and then continued on foot to where Pokkharasati was, saluted him, and sat down to one side.  Then Pokkharasati said: "Well, dear boy, did you see the Reverend Gotama?"  "I did, Sir." "And was the Reverend Gotama such as he is reported to be, and not otherwise?  And is he of such nature, and not otherwise?"   "Sir, he is as he is reported to be, and he is of such nature and not otherwise.  He is possessed of the thirty-two marks of a Great Man, all completed, with none missing." "But was there any conversation between you and the ascetic Gotama?"  "There was, Sir." "And what was this conversation about?"  So Ambattha told Pokkharasati all that had passed between the Lord and himself.
Pride Humbled|2|10| At this Pokkharasati exclaimed:  "Well, you’re a fine little scholar, a fine wise man, a fine expert in the Three Vedas!  Anyone going about his business like that ought when he dies, at the breaking-up of the body, to go to the downfall, to the evil path, to ruin, to hell!  You have heaped insults on the Reverend Gotama, as a result of which he has brought up more and more things against us!  You’re a fine little scholar!"  He was so angry and enraged that he kicked Ambattha over, and wanted to start out at once to see the Lord.
Pride Humbled|2|11| But the Brahmins said:  "It is far too late, Sir, to go to see the ascetic Gotama today.  The Reverend Pokkharasati should go to see him tomorrow." Then Pokkharasati, having had fine hard and soft food prepared in his own home, set out by the light of torches from Ukkattha for the jungle of Icchanankala.  He went by chariot as far as possible, then continued on foot to where the Lord was.  Having exchanged courtesies with the Lord, he sat down to one side and said:
Pride Humbled|2|12| "Venerable Gotama, did not our pupil Ambattha come to see you?"  "He did, Brahmin."  "And was there any conversation between you?  "There was."  "And what was this conversation about?" Then the Lord told Pokkharasati all that had passed between him and Ambattha.  At this, Pokkharasati said to the Lord:  "Reverend Gotama, Ambattha is a young fool.  May the Reverend Gotama pardon him."  "Brahmin, may Ambattha be happy."
Pride Humbled|2|13| Then Pokkharasati looked out for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Lord’s body and he could see all of them except for two:  the sheathed genitals and the large tongue; but the Lord set his mind at rest about these. Then, descending from his lodging, the Lord started to walk up and down, and Pokkharasati did likewise.  And as he walked along with the Lord, Pokkharasati looked out for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Lord’s body.  And he could see all of them except for two.  He was in doubt and perplexity about two of these marks:  he could not make up his mind or be certain about the sheathed genitals or the large tongue
Pride Humbled|2|14| And the Lord, being aware of his doubts, effected by his psychic power that Pokkharasati could see his sheathed genitals, and then, sticking out his tongue, he reached out to lick both ears and both nostrils, and then covered the whole circle of his forehead with his tongue.  Then Ambattha thought:  "The ascetic Gotama is equipped with all the thirty-two marks of a Great Man, complete and with none missing."   Then he said to the Lord:  "Reverend Gotama, may I go now?  I have much business, much to do."  "Pokkharasati, do what you now think fit."  And Pokkharasati said to the Lord:  "May the Reverend Gotama accept a meal from me today together with his order of monks!"  And the Lord consented by silence.
Pride Humbled|2|15| Seeing his acceptance, Pokkharasati said to the Lord:  "It is time, Reverend Gotama, the meal is ready."  And the Lord, having dressed in the early morning and taken his robe and bowl, went with his order of monks to Pokkharasati’s residence, and sat down on the prepared seat.  Then Pokkharasati personally served the Lord with choice hard and soft food, and the young men served the monks.  And when the Lord had taken his hand from the bowl, Pokkharasati sat down to one side on a low stool.
Pride Humbled|2|16| And as Pokkharasati sat there, the Lord delivered a graduated discourse on generosity, on morality and on heaven, showing the danger, degradation and corruption of sense-desires, and the profit of renunciation.  And when the Lord knew that Pokkharasati’s mind was ready, pliable, free from the hindrances, joyful and calm, then he preached a sermon on Dhamma in brief:  on suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.  And just as a clean cloth from which all stains have been removed receives the dye perfectly, so in the Brahmin Pokkharasati, as he sat there, there arose the pure and spotless Dhamma-eye, and he knew:
Pride Humbled|2|17| "Whatever things have an origin must come to cessation." And Pokkharasati, having seen, attained, experienced and penetrated the Dhamma, having passed beyond doubt, transcended uncertainty, having gained perfect confidence in the Teacher’s doctrine without relying on others, said:  "Excellent, Lord, excellent!  It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there.  Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways … I go with my son, my wife, my ministers and counselors for refuge to the Reverend Gotama, to the Dhamma and to the Sangha.   May the Reverend Gotama accept me as a lay-follower who has taken refuge from this day forth as long as life shall last!  And whenever the Reverend Gotama visits other families or lay-followers in Ukkattha, may he also visit the family of Pokkarasati!  Whatever young men and maidens are there will revere the Reverend Gotama and rise before him, will give him a seat and water and will be glad at heart, and that will be for their welfare and happiness for a long time." "Well said, Brahmin!"
Advise to Anaathapindika|1|1| I heard thus: At one time the Blessed One lived in Anathapindika’s monastery in Jeta’s grove in Savatthi. The householder Anathapindika was seriously ill and suffering badly at that time. He addressed a certain man and said. ‘Good man approach the Blessed One, worship the Blessed One for my sake with your head at his feet, and tell. "Venerable sir, the householder Anathapindika is seriously ill. Also approach venerable Shariputra worship venerable Shariputra for my sake with your head at his feet and tell. Venerable sir, the householder Anathapindika is seriously ill, it is good if venerable Shariputra would approach the householder Anathapindika’s house out of compassion."
Advise to Anaathapindika|1|2| That man agreeing, approached the Blessed One, worshipped the Blessed One, sat on a side and said. "Venerable sir, the householder Anathapindika is seriously ill and he worships the Blessed One with his head at the feet of the Blessed One. Then he approached venerable Shariputra, worshipped him, sat on a side and said. "Venerable sir, the householder Anathapindika is seriously ill, he worships venerable Shariputra with his head at the feet of venerable Shariputra and also says, it is good if venerable Shariputra would approach the householder Anathapindika’s house out of compassion."
Advise to Anaathapindika|1|3| Venerable Shariputra accepted the message silently, put on his robes and taking bowl and robes, and accompanied by venerable Ananda as the second recluse, approached the house of Anathapindika. Sitting on the prepared seats venerable Shariputra said. ‘Householder, how are you feeling? Would you survive? Are the unpleasant feelings decreasing or increasing? Do the feelings show the increasing end or the decreasing end?
Advise to Anaathapindika|1|4| Good sir, Shariputra, I do not feel well and will not survive. My unpleasant feelings are severe and increasing, not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings are increasing until the end. Good sir, Shariputra, my top hurts a lot. I feel as though a strong man was giving me a headdress with a strong cloth. I do not feel well and will not survive. My unpleasant feelings are severe and increasing, not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings are increasing until the end. Good sir, Shariputra, my belly hurts a lot as though a lot of air was turning about in my belly. I feel as though a clever butcher or his apprentice was carving my belly with a sharp butcher’s knife I do not feel well and will not survive. My unpleasant feelings are severe and increasing, not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings are increasing until the end. Good sir, Shariputra, there is a lot burning in my body. I feel as though two strong men taking me by my hands and feet are pulling me to a pit of burning embers and are scorching and burning me. I do not feel well and will not survive. My unpleasant feelings are severe and increasing, not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings are increasing until the end.

I will not cling to the fire element, and be settled in it. I will not cling to the air element, and be settled in it. I will not cling to the space element, and be settled in it.

I will not cling to the other world, or entertain thoughts of the other world.     Therefore householder, you should train, I will not cling to anything seen, heard, known through the scents or pursued discursively thinking. Hearing this the householder Anathapindika cried loudly and tears streamed down. Then venerable Ananda asked ‘Householder, do you stick fast or sink?’ [1]
Advise to Anaathapindika|1|15| ‘Good sir Ananda, not that I stick fast or sink. Yet, I have associated the Teacher and Bhikkhus who develop the mind, but have not heard such a discourse before this.’
Advise to Anaathapindika|1|16| Then venerable Shariputra said. ‘Householder, a discourse like this is not given to a lay person wearing white clothes.’
Advise to Anaathapindika|1|17| ‘Good sir, Shariputra, discourses like this should be given to lay persons wearing white clothes. There are clansmen, with few defiling things who deteriorate owing not hearing this sort of discourse. Hearing these they would know the Teaching.’
Advise to Anaathapindika|1|18| Then, venerable Shariputra and venerable Ananda having advised the householder Anathapindika got up from their seats and went away. Soon after they had gone the householder Anathapindika died and was born with the happy ones. [2] Then Anathapindika, the son of gods, when the night was waning, illuminating Jeta’s grove completely with a resplendent light, approached the Blessed One, worshipped and stood on a side and said to the Blessed One.
Advise to Anaathapindika|1|19| ‘This pleasant Jeta’s grove the home of sages in the Community Adorned by the king of the Teaching arouses delight in me. Beings that have death are purified by actions, knowledge And a righteous, virtuous livelihood, but not by clan or wealth. Therefore a wise one, seeing his own good, Discriminating the Teaching, purifies himself Of the Bhikkhus, crossed over, the ones like Shariputra, In wisdom, virtues and appeasement are the foremost.’ Saying this, Anathapindika, the son of the gods waited for the Blessed One’s approval. Knowing the Teacher approves my words, worshipped the Blessed One and went round him with his right towards the Teacher and disappeared from there. Next day the Blessed One, addressed the Bhikkhus. ‘Bhikkhus, a certain son of the gods when the night was waning, illuminating Jeta’s grove completely with a resplendent light, approached me worshipped and stood on a side and said.
Advise to Anaathapindika|1|20| ‘This pleasant Jeta’s grove the home of sages in the Community Adorned by the king of the Teaching arouses delight in me. Beings that have death are purified by actions, knowledge And a righteous, virtuous livelihood, but not by clan or wealth. Therefore a wise one, seeing his own good, Discriminating the Teaching, purifies himself Of the Bhikkhus, crossed over, the ones like Shariputra, In wisdom, virtues and appeasement are the foremost.’ Saying this, that son of the gods waited for my approval. Knowing that I approved his words, worshipped and went round me with his right towards me and disappeared from there.
Advise to Anaathapindika|1|21| Hearing this venerable Ananda said. ‘Venerable sir, is that Anathapindika, the son of the gods? The householder, Anathapindika was made happy by venerable Shariputra.’ ‘Good! Ananda, you are right. You have attained that much, which could be attained through reasoning. He is no other, but Anathapindika the son of the gods’. The Blessed One said thus and venerable Ananda delighted in the words of the Blessed One.

The Discourses on Future Dangers|2|1| Monks, these five future dangers are just enough, when considered, for a monk -- heedful, ardent, and resolute -- to live for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-un-reached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. Which five?
The Discourses on Future Dangers|2|2| There is the case where a monk reminds himself of this: At present I am young, black-haired, endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life. The time will come, though, when this body is beset by old age. When one is overcome with old age and decay, it is not easy to pay attention to the Buddha's teachings. It is not easy to reside in isolated forest or wilderness dwellings. Before this unwelcome, disagreeable, displeasing thing happens, let me first make an effort for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-un-reached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized, so that -- endowed with that Dhamma -- I will live in peace even when old.
The Discourses on Future Dangers|2|2| This is the first future danger that is just enough, when considered, for a monk -- heedful, ardent, and resolute -- to live for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-un-reached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.
The Discourses on Future Dangers|2|3| Furthermore, the monk reminds himself of this: At present I am free from illness and discomfort, endowed with good digestion: not too cold, not too hot, of medium strength and tolerance. The time will come, though, when this body is beset with illness. When one is overcome with illness, it is not easy to pay attention to the Buddha's teachings. It is not easy to reside in isolated forest or wilderness dwellings.

The Discourses on Future Dangers|2|5| Furthermore, the monk reminds himself of this: At present food is plentiful; alms are easy to come by. It is easy to maintain oneself by gleanings and patronage. The time will come, though, when there is famine: Food is scarce, alms are hard to come by, and it is not easy to maintain oneself by gleanings and patronage. When there is famine, people will congregate where food is plentiful. There they will live packed and crowded together. When one is living packed and crowded together, it is not easy to pay attention to the Buddha's teachings. It is not easy to reside in isolated forest or wilderness dwellings. Before this unwelcome, disagreeable, displeasing thing happens, let me first make an effort for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-un-reached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized, so that -- endowed with that Dhamma -- I will live in peace even when there is famine.

The Discourses on Future Dangers|2|7| Furthermore, the monk reminds himself of this: At present people are in harmony, on friendly terms, without quarreling, like milk mixed with water, viewing one another with eyes of affection. The time will come, though, when there is danger and an invasion of savage tribes. Taking power, they will surround the countryside. When there is danger, people will congregate where it is safe. There they will live packed and crowded together. When one is living packed and crowded together, it is not easy to pay attention to the Buddha's teachings. It is not easy to reside in isolated forest or wilderness dwellings. Before this unwelcome, disagreeable, displeasing thing happens, let me first make an effort for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-un-reached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized, so that -- endowed with that Dhamma -- I will live in peace even when there is danger.

The time will come, though, when the Sangha splits. When the Sangha is split, it is not easy to pay attention to the Buddha's teachings. It is not easy to reside in isolated forest or wilderness dwellings. Before this unwelcome, disagreeable, displeasing thing happens, let me first make an effort for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-un-reached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized, so that -- endowed with that Dhamma -- I will live in peace even when the Sangha is split.

The Discourses on Future Dangers|3|1| Monks, these five future dangers, un-arisen at present, will arise in the future. Be alert to them and, being alert, work to get rid of them. Which five?
The Discourses on Future Dangers|3|2| There will be, in the course of the future, monks undeveloped in bodily conduct, undeveloped in virtue, undeveloped in mind, undeveloped in discernment. They -- being undeveloped in bodily conduct, undeveloped in virtue, undeveloped in mind, undeveloped in discernment -- will give full ordination to others and will not be able to discipline them in heightened virtue, heightened mind, heightened discernment. These too will then be undeveloped in bodily conduct... virtue... mind... discernment. They -- being undeveloped in bodily conduct... virtue... mind... discernment -- will give full ordination to still others and will not be able to discipline them in heightened virtue, heightened mind, heightened discernment. These too will then be undeveloped in bodily conduct... virtue... mind... discernment. Thus from corrupt Dhamma comes corrupt discipline; from corrupt discipline, corrupt Dhamma.
The Discourses on Future Dangers|3|3| This, monks, is the first future danger, un-arisen at present that will arise in the future. Be alert to it and, being alert, work to get rid of it. And again, there will be in the course of the future monks undeveloped in bodily conduct, undeveloped in virtue, undeveloped in mind, undeveloped in discernment. They -- being undeveloped in bodily conduct, undeveloped in virtue, undeveloped in mind, undeveloped in discernment -- will take on others as students and will not be able to discipline them in heightened virtue, heightened mind, heightened discernment. These too will then be undeveloped in bodily conduct... virtue... mind... discernment. They -- being undeveloped in bodily conduct... virtue... mind... discernment -- will take on still others as students and will not be able to discipline them in heightened virtue, heightened mind, heightened discernment. These too will then be undeveloped in bodily conduct... virtue... mind... discernment. Thus from corrupt Dhamma comes corrupt discipline; from corrupt discipline, corrupt Dhamma.
The Discourses on Future Dangers|3|4| This, monks, is the second future danger, un-arisen at present that will arise in the future. Be alert to it and, being alert, work to get rid of it. And again, there will be in the course of the future monks undeveloped in bodily conduct... virtue... mind... discernment. They -- being undeveloped in bodily conduct... virtue... mind... discernment -- when giving a talk on higher Dhamma or a talk composed of questions and answers, will fall into dark mental states without being aware of it. Thus from corrupt Dhamma comes corrupt discipline; from corrupt discipline, corrupt Dhamma.
The Discourses on Future Dangers|3|5| This, monks, is the third future danger, un-arisen at present that will arise in the future. Be alert to it and, being alert, work to get rid of it. And again, there will be in the course of the future monks undeveloped in bodily conduct... virtue... mind... discernment. They -- being undeveloped in bodily conduct... virtue... mind... discernment -- will not listen when discourses that are words of the Tathágata -- deep, profound, transcendent, connected with the Void -- are being recited. They will not lend ear, will not set their hearts on knowing them, will not regard these teachings as worth grasping or mastering. But they will listen when discourses that are literary works -- the works of poets, elegant in sound, elegant in rhetoric, the work of outsiders, words of disciples -- are recited. They will lend ear and set their hearts on knowing them. They will regard these teachings as worth grasping and mastering. Thus from corrupt Dhamma comes corrupt discipline; from corrupt discipline, corrupt Dhamma.
The Discourses on Future Dangers|3|6| This, monks, is the fourth future danger, un-arisen at present that will arise in the future. Be alert to it and, being alert, work to get rid of it. And again, there will be in the course of the future monks undeveloped in bodily conduct... virtue... mind... discernment. They -- being undeveloped in bodily conduct... virtue... mind... discernment -- will become elders living in luxury, lethargic, foremost in falling back, shirking the duties of solitude. They will not make an effort for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-un-reached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. They will become an example for later generations, who will become luxurious in their living, lethargic, foremost in falling back, shirking the duties of solitude, and who will not make an effort for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-un-reached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. Thus from corrupt Dhamma comes corrupt discipline; from corrupt discipline, corrupt Dhamma.
The Discourses on Future Dangers|3|7| This, monks, is the fifth future danger, un-arisen at present that will arise in the future. Be alert to it and, being alert, work to get rid of it. These, monks, are the five future dangers, un-arisen at present that will arise in the future. Be alert to them and, being alert, work to get rid of them.
The Discourses on Future Dangers|4|1| Monks, these five future dangers, un-arisen at present, will arise in the future. Be alert to them and, being alert, work to get rid of them. Which five? 
The Discourses on Future Dangers|4|2| There will be, in the course of the future, monks desirous of fine robes. They, desirous of fine robes, will neglect the practice of wearing cast-off cloth; will neglect isolated forest and wilderness dwellings; will move to towns, cities, and royal capitals, taking up residence there. For the sake of a robe they will do many kinds of unseemly, inappropriate things. This, monks, is the first future danger, un-arisen at present that will arise in the future. Be alert to it and, being alert, work to get rid of it.
The Discourses on Future Dangers|4|3| Furthermore, in the course of the future there will be monks desirous of fine food. They, desirous of fine food, will neglect the practice of going for alms; will neglect isolated forest and wilderness dwellings; will move to towns, cities, and royal capitals, taking up residence there and searching out the tip-top tastes with the tip of the tongue. For the sake of food they will do many kinds of unseemly, inappropriate things.
The Discourses on Future Dangers|4|4| This, monks, is the second future danger, un-arisen at present that will arise in the future. Be alert to it and, being alert, work to get rid of it. Furthermore, in the course of the future there will be monks desirous of fine lodgings. They, desirous of fine lodgings, will neglect the practice of living in the wilds; will neglect isolated forest and wilderness dwellings; will move to towns, cities, and royal capitals, taking up residence there. For the sake of lodgings they will do many kinds of unseemly, inappropriate things.
The Discourses on Future Dangers|4|5| This, monks, is the third future danger, un-arisen at present that will arise in the future. Be alert to it and, being alert, work to get rid of it. Furthermore, in the course of the future there will be monks who will live in close association with nuns, female probationers, and female novices. As they interact with nuns, female probationers, and female novices, they can be expected either to lead the holy life dissatisfied or to fall into one of the grosser offenses, leaving the training, returning to a lower way of life.
The Discourses on Future Dangers|4|6| This, monks, is the fourth future danger, un-arisen at present that will arise in the future. Be alert to it and, being alert, work to get rid of it. Furthermore, in the course of the future there will be monks who will live in close association with monastery attendants and novices. As they interact with monastery attendants and novices, they can be expected to live intent on storing up all kinds of possessions and to stake out crops and fields. This is the fifth future danger... This, monks, is the fifth future danger, un-arisen at present that will arise in the future. Be alert to it and, being alert, work to get rid of it.
The Discourses on Future Dangers|4|7| These, monks, are the five future dangers, un-arisen at present that will arise in the future. Be alert to them and, being alert, work to get rid of them.
Debtless|1|1| Then Anathapindika the householder went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him: "There are these four kinds of bliss that can be attained in the proper season, on the proper occasions, by a householder enjoying the pleasures of the senses. Which four? The bliss of having, the bliss of making use of wealth, the bliss of debtless-ness, the bliss of blamelessness.
Debtless|1|2| "And what is the bliss of having? There is the case where the son of a good family has wealth earned through his efforts and enterprise, amassed through the strength of his arm, and piled up through the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained. When he thinks, 'I have wealth earned through my efforts and enterprise, amassed through the strength of my arm, and piled up through the sweat of my brow, righteous wealth righteously gained,' he experiences bliss, he experiences joy. This is called the bliss of having.
Debtless|1|3| "And what is the bliss of making use of wealth? There is the case where the son of a good family, using the wealth earned through his efforts and enterprise, amassed through the strength of his arm, and piled up through the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained, partakes of his wealth and makes merit. When he thinks, 'Using the wealth earned through my efforts and enterprise, amassed through the strength of my arm, and piled up through the sweat of my brow, righteous wealth righteously gained, I partake of wealth and make merit,' he experiences bliss, he experiences joy. This is called the bliss of making use of wealth.
Debtless|1|4| "And what is the bliss of debtless-ness? There is the case where the son of a good family owes no debt, great or small, to anyone at all. When he thinks, 'I owe no debt, great or small, to anyone at all,' he experiences bliss, he experiences joy. This is called the bliss of debtless-ness.
Debtless|1|5| "And what is the bliss of blamelessness? There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with blameless bodily kamma, blameless verbal kamma, blameless mental kamma. When he thinks, 'I am endowed with blameless bodily kamma, blameless verbal kamma, blameless mental kamma,' he experiences bliss, he experiences joy. This is called the bliss of blamelessness.
Debtless|1|6| "These are the four kinds of bliss that can be attained in the proper season, on the proper occasions, by a householder enjoying the pleasures of the senses."
Debtless|1|7| Knowing the bliss of debtless-ness, and recollecting the bliss of having, enjoying the bliss of wealth, the mortal then sees clearly with discernment. Seeing clearly -- the wise one --  he knows both sides: that these are not worth one sixteenth-sixteenth  of the bliss of blamelessness.
To Ananda|1|1| Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, he sat down to one side. As he was sitting there he asked the Blessed One: "Now then, Venerable Gotama, is there a self?" 
To Ananda|1|2| When this was said, the Blessed One was silent.  "Then is there no self?"  A second time, the Blessed One was silent.  Then Vacchagotta the wanderer got up from his seat and left.  Then, not long after Vacchagotta the wanderer had left, Ven. Ananda said to the Blessed One, "Why, lord, did the Blessed One not answer when asked a question by Vacchagotta the wanderer?" 
To Ananda|1|3| "Ananda, if I -- being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is a self -- were to answer that there is a self, that would be conforming with those priests and contemplatives who are exponents of Eternalism [the view that there is an eternal, unchanging soul]. If I -- being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is no self -- were to answer that there is no self, that would be conforming with those priests and contemplatives who are exponents of Annihilationism [the view that death is the annihilation of consciousness]. If I -- being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is a self -- were to answer that there is a self, would that be in keeping with the arising of knowledge that all phenomena are not-self?" "No, lord." 
To Ananda|1|4| "And if I -- being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is no self -- were to answer that there is no self, the bewildered Vacchagotta would become even more bewildered: 'Does the self I used to have now not exist?'" 
To Ananda: On Mindfulness of Breathing|1|1| I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. Then Ven. Ananda went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, bowed down to him and sat to one side. As he was sitting there he addressed the Blessed One, saying, "Is there one quality that, when developed and pursued, brings four qualities to completion? And four qualities that, when developed and pursued, bring seven qualities to completion? And seven qualities that, when developed and pursued, bring two qualities to completion?" 
To Ananda: On Mindfulness of Breathing|1|2| "Yes, Ananda, there is one quality that, when developed and pursued, brings four qualities to completion; and four qualities that, when developed and pursued, bring seven qualities to completion; and seven qualities that, when developed and pursued, bring two qualities to completion. And what is the one quality that, when developed and pursued, brings four qualities to completion? What are the four qualities that, when developed and pursued, bring seven qualities to completion? What are the seven qualities that, when developed and pursued, bring two qualities to completion? 
To Ananda: On Mindfulness of Breathing|1|3| "Mindfulness of in-and-out breathing, when developed and pursued, brings the four frames of reference (foundations of mindfulness) to completion. The four frames of reference, when developed and pursued, bring the seven factors for Awakening to completion. The seven factors for awakening, when developed and pursued, bring clear knowing and release to completion. 
To Ananda: On Mindfulness of Breathing|1|4| "Now how is mindfulness of in-and-out breathing developed and pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination? 
To Ananda: On Mindfulness of Breathing|1|5| "There is the case where a monk, having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building, sits down folding his legs crosswise, holding his body erect, and setting mindfulness to the fore. Always mindful, he breathes in; mindful he breathes out. 
To Ananda: On Mindfulness of Breathing|1|6| "[1] Breathing in long, he discerns that he is breathing in long; or breathing out long, he discerns that he is breathing out long. [2] Or breathing in short, he discerns that he is breathing in short; or breathing out short, he discerns that he is breathing out short. [3] He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to the entire body, and to breathe out sensitive to the entire body. [4] He trains himself to breathe in calming the bodily processes, and to breathe out calming the bodily processes. 
To Ananda: On Mindfulness of Breathing|1|7| "[5] He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to rapture, and to breathe out sensitive to rapture. [6] He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to pleasure, and to breathe out sensitive to pleasure. [7] He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to mental processes, and to breathe out sensitive to mental processes. [8] He trains himself to breathe in calming mental processes, and to breathe out calming mental processes. 
To Ananda: On Mindfulness of Breathing|1|8| "[9] He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to the mind, and to breathe out sensitive to the mind. [10] He trains himself to breathe in satisfying the mind, and to breathe out satisfying the mind. [11] He trains himself to breathe in steadying the mind, and to breathe out steadying the mind. [12] He trains himself to breathe in releasing the mind, and to breathe out releasing the mind. 
To Ananda: On Mindfulness of Breathing|1|9| "[13] He trains himself to breathe in focusing on inconstancy, and to breathe out focusing on inconstancy. [14] He trains himself to breathe in focusing on dispassion [literally, fading], and to breathe out focusing on dispassion. [15] He trains himself to breathe in focusing on cessation, and to breathe out focusing on cessation. [16] He trains himself to breathe in focusing on relinquishment, and to breathe out focusing on relinquishment. 
The Four Frames of Reference|1|1|  "[1] Now, on whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns that he is breathing in long; or breathing out long, discerns that he is breathing out long; or breathing in short, discerns that he is breathing in short; or breathing out short, discerns that he is breathing out short; trains himself to breathe in... and... out sensitive to the entire body; trains himself to breathe in... and... out calming the bodily processes: On that occasion the monk remains focused on the body in and of itself -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- subduing greed and distress with reference to the world. I tell you that this -- the in-and-out breath -- is classed as a body among bodies, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in and of itself -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world. 
The Four Frames of Reference|1|2| "[2] On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in... and... out sensitive to rapture; trains himself to breathe in... and... out sensitive to pleasure; trains himself to breathe in... and... out sensitive to mental processes; trains himself to breathe in... and... out calming mental processes: On that occasion the monk remains focused on feelings in and of themselves -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- subduing greed and distress with reference to the world. I tell you that this -- close attention to in-and-out breaths -- is classed as a feeling among feelings, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on feelings in and of themselves -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world. 
The Four Frames of Reference|1|3| "[3] On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in... and... out sensitive to the mind; trains himself to breathe in... and... out satisfying the mind; trains himself to breathe in... and... out steadying the mind; trains himself to breathe in... and... out releasing the mind: On that occasion the monk remains focused on the mind in and of itself -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- subduing greed and distress with reference to the world. I don't say that there is mindfulness of in-and-out breathing in one of confused mindfulness and no alertness, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in and of itself -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world. 
The Four Frames of Reference|1|4| "[4] On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in... and... out focusing on inconstancy; trains himself to breathe in... and... out focusing on dispassion; trains himself to breathe in... and... out focusing on cessation; trains himself to breathe in... and... out focusing on relinquishment: On that occasion the monk remains focused on mental qualities in and of themselves -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- subduing greed and distress with reference to the world. He who sees clearly with discernment the abandoning of greed and distress is one who oversees with equanimity, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in and of themselves -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world. "This is how mindfulness of in-and-out breathing is developed and pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination. 
The Seven Factors for Awakening|1|1|  "And how are the four frames of reference developed and pursued so as to bring the seven factors for Awakening to their culmination? 
The Seven Factors for Awakening|1|2| "[1] On whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the body in and of itself -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world, on that occasion his mindfulness is steady and without lapse. When his mindfulness is steady and without lapse, then mindfulness as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development. 
The Seven Factors for Awakening|1|3| "[2] Remaining mindful in this way, he examines, analyzes, and comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment. When he remains mindful in this way, examining, analyzing, and coming to a comprehension of that quality with discernment, then analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development. 
The Seven Factors for Awakening|1|4| "[3] In one who examines, analyzes, and comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment, unflagging persistence is aroused. When unflagging persistence is aroused in one who examines, analyzes, and comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment, then persistence as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development. 
The Seven Factors for Awakening|1|5| "[4] In one whose persistence is aroused, a rapture not-of-the-flesh arises. When a rapture not-of-the-flesh arises in one whose persistence is aroused, then rapture as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development. 
The Seven Factors for Awakening|1|6| "[5] For one who is enraptured, the body grows calm and the mind grows calm. When the body and mind of an enraptured monk grow calm, then serenity as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development. 
The Seven Factors for Awakening|1|7| "[6] For one who is at ease -- his body calmed -- the mind becomes concentrated. When the mind of one who is at ease -- his body calmed -- becomes concentrated, then concentration as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development. 
The Seven Factors for Awakening|1|8| "[7] He oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity. When he oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity, equanimity as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development. 
The Seven Factors for Awakening|1|9| Similarly with the other three frames of reference: feelings, mind, and mental qualities. "This is how the four frames of reference are developed and pursued so as to bring the seven factors for Awakening to their culmination. 
Clear Knowing and Release|1|1|  "And how are the seven factors for Awakening developed and pursued so as to bring clear knowing and release to their culmination? There is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion... dispassion... cessation, resulting in relinquishment. He develops analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening... persistence as a factor for Awakening... rapture as a factor for Awakening... serenity as a factor for Awakening... concentration as a factor for Awakening... equanimity as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion... dispassion... cessation, resulting in relinquishment. 
Clear Knowing and Release|1|2| "This is how the seven factors for awakening, when developed and pursued, bring clear knowing and release to their culmination." 
Clear Knowing and Release|1|3| That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, Ven. Ananda delighted in the Blessed One's words. 
Instructions to Vangisa|1|1| On one occasion Ven. Ananda was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery. Then early in the morning he put on his robes and, carrying his bowl and outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms with Ven. Vangisa as his attendant monk. Now at that time dissatisfaction with the chaste life had arisen in Ven. Vangisa. Lust invaded his mind. So he addressed Ven. Ananda with this verse: 
Instructions to Vangisa|1|2| With sensual lust I burn. My mind is on fire. Please, Gotama, from compassion, tell me how to put it out.  From distorted perception  your mind is on fire. Shun the theme of the beautiful  accompanied by lust. See mental fabrications as other,  as stress,  and not-self. Extinguish your great lust.  Don't keep burning again and again.  Develop the mind  -- well centered and one --  in the foul, through the foul. Have your mindfulness  immersed in the body. Be one who pursues  disenchantment. Develop the theme-less. Cast out conceit. Then, from breaking through  conceit,  you will go on your way at peace. 
A single Auspicious Attachment to Venerable Ananda|1|1| I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anathapindika in Jeta’s grove in Savatthi. At that time venerable Ananda was in the attendance hall, instructing, advising, and making the hearts light of the Bhikkhus, with the short and detailed exposition of the single auspicious attachment. Then the Blessed One got up from his seclusion in the evening approached the attendance hall sat on the prepared seat and addressed the Bhikkhus. ‘Bhikkhus, who was instructing, advising, and making the hearts light of the Bhikkhus in the attendance hall, with the short and detailed exposition of the single auspicious attachment?’

Blemishes|1|1| I heard thus: At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anathapindika in Jeta’s grove in Savatthi. Venerable Shariputra addressed the Bhikkhus:" Friends, Bhikkhus," and those Bhikkhus replied "Yes, friend." And venerable Shariputra said: Friends, there are four persons in the world, what four?
Blemishes|1|2| "Here, a certain person with blemish does not know, as it really is, 'there is blemish in me.' A certain person with blemish knows, as it really is, 'there is blemish in me.' A certain person without blemish does not know as it really is, 'there is no blemish in me.' A certain person without blemish knows as it really is, 'there is no blemish in me.' Of the two persons with blemish, the one who does not know as it really is, 'there is blemish in me' is the inferior The one who knows as it really is, 'there is blemish in me' is the superior one.
Blemishes|1|3| Of the two persons without blemish, the one who does not know, as it really is, 'there is no blemish' is the inferior one. The one who knows as it really is, 'there is no blemish in me' is the superior. When this was said, venerable Maha Moggallana said , Friend, Shariputra, what is the reason that of the two with blemish that one should be inferior and the other superior and of the other two without blemish, what is the reason that one should be inferior and the other superior.
Blemishes|1|4| Here, friend, Moggallana, this person with blemish, who does not know, as it really is, 'there is blemish in me,' would not arouse interest, and make effort to dispel that blemish. So he would die with a defiled mind with greed, hate and delusion. Just like a bronze bowl bought from a shop or smithy would be covered with dust and stains, its owner not partaking food in it would not clean it, would let it lie with dust and as time goes that bronze bowl would be much more dusty and stained. In the same way this person with blemish, who would not know, as it really is, 'there is blemish in me,' would not arouse interest, and make effort to dispel that blemish. So he would die with a defiled mind with greed, hate and delusion.
Blemishes|1|5| Friend, this person with blemish, who knows, as it really is, 'there is blemish in me,' would arouse interest, and make effort to dispel that blemish. He would die with a non-defiled mind without greed, hate and delusion. Just like a bronze bowl bought from a shop or smithy would be covered with dust and stains. Its owner partaking food in it would clean it. Would not let it lie with dirt and as time goes the bronze bowl would be more and more clean. In the same manner this person with blemish, who knows, as it really is, 'there is blemish in me,' would arouse interest and make effort to dispel that blemish. So he would die with a non-defiled mind without greed, hate, and delusion.
Blemishes|1|6| Friend, this person without blemish, who does not know, as it really is, 'there is no blemish in me,' attending to an agreeable sign, greed would overcome his mind, hate and delusion would overcome his mind and he would die with a defiled mind. Just like a bronze bowl bought from a shop or smithy clean and pure, the owner would not partake in it, would let it lie with dirt, then as time goes, that bronze bowl would be more and more dusty and stained in the same manner this person without blemish, who does not know, as it really is, 'there is no blemish in me,' attending to an agreeable sign greed would overcome his mind, hate and delusion would overcome his mind and he would die with a defiled mind.
Blemishes|1|7| Friend, this person without blemish, who knows, as it really is, 'there is no blemish in me,' attending to an agreeable sign, greed would not overcome his mind, hate and delusions would not overcome his mind. He would die without greed, hate and delusion; He would die with an undefiled mind. Just like a bronze bowl bought from a shop or smithy, clean and pure, the owner would partake in it, would clean it and not let it lie in dirt, and as time goes that bronze bowl would be more and more clean. In the same manner this person without blemish, who knows, as it really is, 'there is no blemish in me,' attending to an agreeable sign, greed, would not overcome his mind, hate and delusion would not overcome his mind. He would die without greed, hate and delusion. He would die with an undefiled mind.

People seeing it would say, friend, what is it you are carrying, seems to be something delicious. Then they would stop him, open it and peep inside. At the sight of it disgust and running away from it gets established. Those hungry lose their appetite, what’s there to speak of those not hungry. Friend, in the same manner to whatever Bhikkhu these wanderings of thought in evil demerit are seen and heard to be present, whoever he may be, a forest dweller, a leaves hut dweller, a partaker of morsel food going in due order, a wearer of rough rag robes, his co-associates in the holy life do not honor, revere and venerate him. What is the reason: Because the wanderings of thoughts in evil demerit are seen and heard to be not dispelled in him. 
Blemishes|1|27| Friend, to whatever Bhikkhu these wanderings of thought in evil demerit are seen and heard to be dispelled, whoever he may be a dweller in the out skirts of the village, an invitee, a wearer of robes offered by householders, his co-associates in the holy life honor, revere and venerate him. What is the reason: Because the wanderings of thoughts in evil demerit are seen and heard to be dispelled in him. Just as a bronze bowl pure and clean bought from a shop or a smithy, its owner would fill up with cooked fine rice, dark seeds picked with various soups and curries. Covering it up with another bowl would carry it to the fair. People seeing it would say, friend, what is it you are carrying, seems to be something delicious. Then they would stop him, open it and peep inside. At the sight of it agreeability and a desire to eat gets established. Even those not hungry desire to eat it, what to speak of those hungry. Friend, in the same manner, to whatever Bhikkhu these wanderings of thought in evil demerit are seen and heard to be dispelled whoever he may be a dweller in the out skirts of the village, an invitee, a wearer of robes offered by householders, his co-associates in the holy life honor, revere and venerate him. What is the reason: Because the wanderings of thoughts in evil demerit are seen and heard to be dispelled in him...
Blemishes|1|28| When this was said venerable Maha Moggallana said: Friend, Shariputra, a comparison occurs to me. "Friend, say it." "Friend, at one time, I was living in the mountains of Rajagaha. Then one morning wearing robes and taking bowl and robes I entered Rajagaha. At that time Samiiti the chariot maker’s son was bending the circumference of a wheel for an ascetic, the son of Pandu, the earlier chariot maker.  Then it occurred to the ascetic, O! If Samiiti’s son corrects these crooked-nesses, slants, and faults and makes the wheel perfect. Whatever crookedness, slant, or fault that the ascetic thought of, that and that he corrected and made the circumference of the wheel perfect. Then the ascetic expressed words of pleasure and said. 'It's like he knew the heart with the heart.' Friend, Shariputra, in the same manner, those making a livelihood without faith, crafty hypocrites, trained deceivers, unsteady, wavering, with loose talk, mental faculties not restrained, not knowing the right amount to partake, not yoked to wakefulness and not desirous of the recluse -ship, not honoring the training, living in abundance and lethargy, unyoked from seclusion, without effort, not mindful and aware, not concentrated, those lacking in wisdom deaf and dumb, hearing this discourse should know the heart with the heart and make repairs.
Blemishes|1|29| As for those sons of clansmen gone forth out of faith, not crafty, not hypocrites, not trained deceivers, steady, without loose talk, mental faculties restrained, yoked to wakefulness, desirous of the recluse-ship, honoring the training, not living in abundance and lethargy, yoked to seclusion with effort, mindful and aware, concentrated and wise, they hearing this discourse of venerable Shariputra, I think should devour the word and thought of it. Good if the co-associates in the holy life raised themselves from demerit and got established in merit." The two great men delighted in each other’s words.
Without Blemishes|1|1| Thus have I heard: On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There the venerable Shariputra addressed the Monks thus, "Friends, Monks." – "Friend," they replied. The venerable Shariputra said this,
Without Blemishes|1|2| "Friends, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? Here some person with a blemish does not understand it as it actually is thus, ‘I have a blemish in myself.’ Here some person with a blemish understands it as it actually is thus, ‘I have a blemish in myself.’ Here some person with no blemish does not understand it as it actually is thus, ‘I have no blemish in myself.’ Here some person with no blemish understands it as it actually is thus, ‘I have no blemish in myself.’
Without Blemishes|1|3| "Herein, the person with a blemish who does not understand it as it actually is thus, ‘I have a blemish in myself’ is called the inferior of the two persons with a blemish. Herein, the person with a blemish who understands it as it actually is thus, ‘I have a blemish in myself’ is called the superior of these two persons with a blemish.
Without Blemishes|1|4| "Herein, the person with no blemish who does not understand it as it actually is thus, ‘I have no blemish’ is called the inferior of these two persons with no blemish. Herein, the person with no blemish who understands it as it actually is thus, ‘I have no blemish’ is called the superior of these two persons with no blemish."
Without Blemishes|1|5| When this was said, the venerable Maha Moggallana asked the venerable Shariputra, "Friend Shariputra, what is the cause and reason why, of these two persons with a blemish, one is called the inferior man and one is called the superior man? What is the cause and reason why, of these two persons with no blemish, one is called the inferior man and one is called the superior man?"
Without Blemishes|1|6| "Herein, friend, when a person with a blemish does not understand it as it is thus, ‘I have a blemish in myself,’ it can be expected that he will not arouse zeal, make effort, or instigate energy to abandon that blemish, and that he will die with lust, hate, and delusion, with a blemish, with mind defiled. Suppose a bronze dish were brought from a shop or a smithy covered with dirt and stains, and the owners neither used it nor had it cleaned, but put it away in a dusty corner. Would the bronze dish thus get more defiled and stained later on?" – "Yes, friend." – "So too, Friend, when a person with a blemish does not understand it as it is actually thus, ‘I have a blemish in myself,’ it can be expected that he will not arouse zeal, make effort, or instigate energy to abandon that blemish, and that he will die with lust, hate, and delusion, with a blemish, with mind defiled.

Suppose a bronze dish were brought from a shop or a smithy covered with dirt and stains, and the owners had cleaned it and did not put it in a dusty corner.

Without Blemishes|1|10| "This is the cause and reason why, of these two persons with a blemish, one is called the inferior man and one is called the superior man. This is the cause and reason why, of these two persons with no blemish, one is called the inferior man and one is called the superior man.
Without Blemishes|1|11| "Blemish, blemish, is said friend, but what is this word Blemish a term for?" "Blemish, friend, is a term for the spheres of evil unwholesome wishes.
Without Blemishes|1|12| "It is possible that a Monk here might wish, ‘If I commit an offence, let the Monks not know that I have committed an offence.’ And it is possible that the Monks come to know that that Monk has committed an offence.

Without Blemishes|1|27| When this was said, the Venerable Maha Moggallana said to the Venerable Shariputra, "A simile occurs to me friend Shariputra." – "State it friend Moggallana."
Without Blemishes|1|28| "On one occasion, friend, I was living at the Hill Fort at Rajagaha. Then, when it was morning, I dressed, and taking my bowl and outer robe, I went into Rajagaha for alms. Now on that occasion Samiti, the Cartwright’s Son, was smoothing a beam of wood and the Ajivaka [A rival sect that practices severe austerities and believed in the concept of fate.] Panduputta, son of a former Cartwright was standing by. Then this thought arose in the Ajivaka Panduputta’s mind, ‘O that this Samiti, the Cartwright Son might plane this bend, this twist, this fault out of the wood so that it would be without bends, twists, or faults and come to consist purely of heartwood.’ And just as this thought came to pass in his mind so did Samiti, the Cartwright’s Son plane that bend, that twist, that fault, out of the wood. Then the Ajivaka Panduputta, son of a former Cartwright was glad and he voiced his gladness thus, ‘He planes just as if he knew my heart with his heart!’
Without Blemishes|1|29| "So too friend, there are persons who are faithless and have gone forth from the home life into homelessness not out of faith, but seeking a livelihood, who are fraudulent, deceitful, treacherous, haughty, hollow, personally vain, rough tongued, loose spoken, unguarded in the sense faculties, immoderate in eating, un-devoted to wakefulness, unconcerned with recluse-ship, not greatly respectful of training, luxurious, careless, leaders in backsliding, neglectful of seclusion, lazy, wanting in energy, unmindful, not fully aware, un-concentrated, with straying minds, devoid of wisdom, drivellers. The venerable Shariputra with his discourse on the Dhamma planes out their faults just as if he knew my heart with his heart!"
Without Blemishes|1|30| "But there are clansmen who have gone forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness, who are not fraudulent, deceitful, treacherous, haughty, hollow, personally vain, rough tongued, or loose spoken; who are guarded in their sense faculties, moderate in eating, devoted to wakefulness, concerned with recluse-ship, greatly respectful of training, not luxurious or careless, who are keen to avoid backsliding, leaders in seclusion, energetic, resolute, established in mindfulness, fully aware, concentrated, with unified minds, possessing wisdom, not drivellers. These, on hearing the venerable Shariputra’s discourse on the Dhamma drink it in and eat it as it were by word and thought. Good indeed it is that he makes his fellows in the holy life emerge from the unwholesome and establish themselves in the wholesome.
Without Blemishes|1|31| "Just as a woman or a man, young, youthful, fond of adornments, with head bathed, having received a garland of lotuses, jasmine, or roses would take it with both hands and place it on the head, so too there are clansmen who have gone forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness who are not fraudulent, deceitful, treacherous, haughty, hollow, personally vain, rough tongued, or loose spoken; who are guarded in their sense faculties, moderate in eating, devoted to wakefulness, concerned with recluse-ship, greatly respectful of training, not luxurious or careless, who are keen to avoid backsliding, leaders in seclusion, energetic, resolute, established in mindfulness, fully aware, concentrated, with unified minds, possessing wisdom, not drivellers. These, on hearing the venerable Shariputra discourse on the Dhamma drink it in and eat it as it were by word and thought. Good indeed it is that he makes his fellows in the holy life emerge from the unwholesome and establish himself in the wholesome." Thus it was that these two great beings rejoiced in each others good words.
Mindfulness of Breathing|1|1| I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in the Eastern Monastery, the palace of Migara's mother, together will many well-known elder disciples -- with Ven. Shariputra, Ven. Maha Moggallana, Ven. Maha Kassapa, Ven. Maha Kaccayana, Ven. Maha Kotthita, Ven. Maha Kappina, Ven. Maha Cunda, Ven. Revata, Ven. Ananda, and other well-known elder disciples. On that occasion the elder monks were teaching and instructing. Some elder monks were teaching and instructing ten monks, some were teaching and instructing twenty monks, some were teaching and instructing thirty monks, some were teaching and instructing forty monks. The new monks, being taught and instructed by the elder monks, were discerning grand, successive distinctions.
Mindfulness of Breathing|1|2| Now on that occasion -- the Uposatha day of the fifteenth, the full-moon night of the Pavarana ceremony -- the Blessed One was seated in the open air surrounded by the community of monks. Surveying the silent community of monks, he addressed them:
Mindfulness of Breathing|1|3| "Monks, I am content with this practice. I am content at heart with this practice. So arouse even more intense persistence for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-un-reached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. I will remain right here at Savatthi [for another month] through the 'White water-lily' month, the fourth month of the rains."
Mindfulness of Breathing|1|4| The monks in the countryside heard, "The Blessed One, they say, will remain right there at Savatthi through the White water-lily month, the fourth month of the rains." So they left for Savatthi to see the Blessed One.
Mindfulness of Breathing|1|5| Then the elder monks taught and instructed even more intensely. Some elder monks were teaching and instructing ten monks, some were teaching and instructing twenty monks, some were teaching and instructing thirty monks, some were teaching and instructing forty monks. The new monks, being taught and instructed by the elder monks, were discerning grand, successive distinctions.
Mindfulness of Breathing|1|6| Now on that occasion -- the Uposatha day of the fifteenth, the full-moon night of the White water-lily month, the fourth month of the rains -- the Blessed One was seated in the open air surrounded by the community of monks. Surveying the silent community of monks, he addressed them:
Mindfulness of Breathing|1|7| "Monks, this assembly is free from idle chatter, devoid of idle chatter, and is established on pure heartwood: such is this community of monks, such is this assembly. The sort of assembly that is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, an incomparable field of merit for the world: such is this community of monks such is this assembly. The sort of assembly to which a small gift, when given, becomes great, and a great gift greater: such is this community of monks such is this assembly. The sort of assembly that it is rare to see in the world: such is this community of monks, such is this assembly -- the sort of assembly that it would be worth traveling for leagues, taking along provisions, in order to see.
Mindfulness of Breathing|1|8| "In this community of monks there are monks who are Arahants, whose mental effluents are ended, who have reached fulfillment, done the task, laid down the burden attained the true goal, totally destroyed the fetter of becoming, and who are released through right gnosis: such are the monks in this community of monks.
Mindfulness of Breathing|1|9| "In this community of monks there are monks who, with the total ending of the first set of five fetters, are due to be reborn [in the Pure Abodes], there to be totally unbound, never again to return from that world: such are the monks in this community of monks.
Mindfulness of Breathing|1|10| "In this community of monks there are monks who, with the totally ending of [the first] three fetters, and the with attenuation of passion, aversion, and delusion, are once-returners, who -- on returning only one more time to this world -- will make an ending to stress: such are the monks in this community of monks.
Mindfulness of Breathing|1|11| "In this community of monks there are monks who, with the total ending of [the first] three fetters, are stream-winners, steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for self-awakening: such are the monks in this community of monks.
Mindfulness of Breathing|1|12| "In this community of monks there are monks who remain devoted to the development of the four frames of reference ... the four right exertions ... the four bases of power ... the five faculties ... the five strengths ... the seven factors of awakening ... the noble eightfold path: such are the monks in this community of monks.
Mindfulness of Breathing|1|13| "In this community of monks there are monks who remain devoted to the development of good will ... compassion ... appreciation ... equanimity ... the perception of the foulness of the body ... the perception of inconstancy: such are the monks in this community of monks.
Mindfulness of Breathing|1|14| "In this community of monks there are monks who remain devoted to mindfulness of in-and-out breathing. "Mindfulness of in-and-out breath, when developed and pursued, is of great fruit, of great benefit. Mindfulness of in-and-out breathing, when developed and pursued, brings the four frames of reference to their culmination. The four frames of reference, when developed and pursued, bring the seven factors of awakening to their culmination. The seven factors of awakening, when developed and pursued, bring clear knowing and release to their culmination.
Mindfulness of In-and-Out Breathing|1|1| "Now how is mindfulness of in-and-out breathing developed and pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination?
Mindfulness of In-and-Out Breathing|1|2| "There is the case where a monk, having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building, sits down folding his legs crosswise, holding his body erect, and setting mindfulness to the fore. Always mindful, he breathes in; mindful he breathes out. "[1] Breathing in long, he discerns that he is breathing in long; or breathing out long, he discerns that he is breathing out long. [2] Or breathing in short, he discerns that he is breathing in short; or breathing out short, he discerns that he is breathing out short. [3] He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to the entire body, and to breathe out sensitive to the entire body. [4] He trains himself to breathe in calming the bodily processes, and to breathe out calming the bodily processes.
Mindfulness of In-and-Out Breathing|1|3| "[5] He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to rapture, and to breathe out sensitive to rapture. [6] He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to pleasure, and to breathe out sensitive to pleasure. [7] He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to mental processes, and to breathe out sensitive to mental processes. [8] He trains himself to breathe in calming mental processes, and to breathe out calming mental processes.
Mindfulness of In-and-Out Breathing|1|4| "[9] He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to the mind, and to breathe out sensitive to the mind. [10] He trains himself to breathe in satisfying the mind, and to breathe out satisfying the mind. [11] He trains himself to breathe in steadying the mind, and to breathe out steadying the mind. [12] He trains himself to breathe in releasing the mind, and to breathe out releasing the mind.
Mindfulness of In-and-Out Breathing|1|5| "[13] He trains himself to breathe in focusing on inconstancy, and to breathe out focusing on inconstancy. [14] He trains himself to breathe in focusing on dispassion [literally, fading], and to breathe out focusing on dispassion. [15] He trains himself to breathe in focusing on cessation, and to breathe out focusing on cessation. [16] He trains himself to breathe in focusing on relinquishment, and to breathe out focusing on relinquishment.
The Four Frames of Reference|2|1| "[1] Now, on whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns that he is breathing in long; or breathing out long, discerns that he is breathing out long; or breathing in short, discerns that he is breathing in short; or breathing out short, discerns that he is breathing out short; trains himself to breathe in...and... out sensitive to the entire body; trains himself to breathe in...and...out calming the bodily processes: On that occasion the monk remains focused on the body in and of itself -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- subduing greed and distress with reference to the world. I tell you, monks, that this -- the in-and-out breath -- is classed as a body among bodies, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in and of itself -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world.
The Four Frames of Reference|2|2| "[2] On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in...and...out sensitive to rapture; trains himself to breathe in...and...out sensitive to pleasure; trains himself to breathe in...and...out sensitive to mental processes; trains himself to breathe in...and...out calming mental processes: On that occasion the monk remains focused on feelings in and of themselves -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- subduing greed and distress with reference to the world. I tell you, monks, that this -- close attention to in-and-out breaths -- is classed as a feeling among feelings, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on feelings in and of themselves -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world.
The Four Frames of Reference|2|3| "[3] On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in...and...out sensitive to the mind; trains himself to breathe in...and...out satisfying the mind; trains himself to breathe in...and...out steadying the mind; trains himself to breathe in...and...out releasing the mind: On that occasion the monk remains focused on the mind in and of itself -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- subduing greed and distress with reference to the world. I don't say that there is mindfulness of in-and-out breathing in one of confused mindfulness and no alertness, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in and of itself -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world.
The Four Frames of Reference|2|4| "[4] On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in...and...out focusing on inconstancy; trains himself to breathe in...and...out focusing on dispassion; trains himself to breathe in...and...out focusing on cessation; trains himself to breathe in...and...out focusing on relinquishment: On that occasion the monk remains focused on mental qualities in and of themselves -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- subduing greed and distress with reference to the world. He who sees clearly with discernment the abandoning of greed and distress is one who oversees with equanimity, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in and of themselves -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world.
The Four Frames of Reference|2|5| "This is how mindfulness of in-and-out breathing is developed and pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination.
The Seven Factors Of Awakening|1|1| "And how are the four frames of reference developed and pursued so as to bring the seven factors of awakening to their culmination?
The Seven Factors Of Awakening|2|2| "[1] On whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the body in and of itself -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world, on that occasion his mindfulness is steady and without lapse. When his mindfulness is steady and without lapse, then mindfulness as a factor of awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.
The Seven Factors Of Awakening|2|3| "[2] Remaining mindful in this way, he examines, analyzes, and comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment. When he remains mindful in this way, examining, analyzing, and coming to a comprehension of that quality with discernment, then analysis of qualities as a factor of awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.
The Seven Factors Of Awakening|2|4| "[3] In one who examines, analyzes, and comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment, unflagging persistence is aroused. When unflagging persistence is aroused in one who examines, analyzes, and comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment, then persistence as a factor of awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.
The Seven Factors Of Awakening|2|5| "[4] In one whose persistence is aroused, a rapture not-of-the-flesh arises. When a rapture not-of-the-flesh arises in one whose persistence is aroused, then rapture as a factor of awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.
The Seven Factors Of Awakening|2|6| "[5] For one who is enraptured, the body grows calm and the mind grows calm. When the body and mind of an enraptured monk grow calm, then serenity as a factor of awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.
The Seven Factors Of Awakening|2|7| "[6] For one who is at ease -- his body calmed -- the mind becomes concentrated. When the mind of one who is at ease -- his body calmed -- becomes concentrated, then concentration as a factor of awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.
The Seven Factors Of Awakening|2|8| "[7] He oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity. When he oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity, equanimity as a factor of awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development. [Similarly with the other three frames of reference: feelings, mind, and mental qualities.] "This is how the four frames of reference are developed and pursued so as to bring the seven factors of awakening to their culmination.
Clear Knowing and Release|2|1| "And how are the seven factors of awakening developed and pursued so as to bring clear knowing and release to their culmination? There is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor of awakening dependent on seclusion ... dispassion ... cessation, resulting in relinquishment. He develops analysis of qualities as a factor of awakening ... persistence as a factor of awakening ... rapture as a factor of awakening ... serenity as a factor of awakening... concentration as a factor of awakening ... equanimity as a factor of awakening dependent on seclusion ... dispassion ... cessation, resulting in relinquishment.
Clear Knowing and Release|2|2| "This is how the seven factors of awakening, when developed and pursued, bring clear knowing and release to their culmination." That is what the Blessed One said. Glad at heart, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|1| I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery. And on that occasion Anathapindika the householder was diseased, in pain, severely ill. Then Anathapindika the householder said to one of his men, "Come, my good man. Go to the Blessed One and, on arrival, pay homage to his feet with your head in my name and say 'Lord, Anathapindika the householder is diseased, in pain, severely ill. He pays homage with his head to the Blessed One's feet.' Then go to Ven. Sariputta and, on arrival, pay homage to his feet with your head in my name and say 'Venerable sir, Anathapindika the householder is diseased, in pain, severely ill. He pays homage with his head to your feet.' Then say: 'It would be good if Ven. Sariputta would visit Anathapindika's home, out of sympathy for him.'"
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|2| Responding, "As you say, lord," to Anathapindika the householder, the man went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, bowed down to him and sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said, "Lord, Anathapindika the householder is diseased, in pain, severely ill. He pays homage with his head to the Blessed One's feet." Then he went to Ven. Sariputta and, on arrival, on arrival, bowed down to him and sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said, 'Venerable sir, Anathapindika the householder is diseased, in pain, severely ill. He pays homage with his head to your feet." Then he said, "It would be good if Ven. Sariputta would visit Anathapindika's home, out of sympathy for him."
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|3| Then Ven. Sariputta, taking his bowl & robe, went to the home of Anathapindika the householder with Ven. Ananda as his attendant. On arrival, he sat down on a prepared seat and said to Anathapindika the householder: "I hope you are getting better, householder. I hope you are comfortable. I hope that your pains are lessening and not increasing. I hope that there are signs of their lessening, and not of their increasing."
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|4| [Anathapindika:] "I am not getting better, venerable sir. I am not comfortable. My extreme pains are increasing, not lessening. There are signs of their increasing, and not of their lessening. Extreme forces slice through my head, just as if a strong man were slicing my head open with a sharp sword... Extreme pains have arisen in my head, just as if a strong man were tightening a turban made of tough leather straps around my head... Extreme forces carve up my stomach cavity, just as if a butcher or his apprentice were to carve up the stomach cavity of an ox... There is an extreme burning in my body, just as if two strong men, grabbing a weaker man by the arms, were to roast and broil him over a pit of hot embers. I am not getting better, venerable sir. I am not comfortable. My extreme pains are increasing, not lessening. There are signs of their increasing, and not of their lessening."
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|5| [Ven. Sariputta:] "Then, householder, you should train yourself in this way: 'I won't cling to the eye; my consciousness will not be dependent on the eye.' That's how you should train yourself. 'I won't cling to the ear... nose... tongue... body; my consciousness will not be dependent on the body.' ... 'I won't cling to the intellect; my consciousness will not be dependent on the intellect.' That's how you should train yourself.
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|6| "Then, householder, you should train yourself in this way: 'I won't cling to forms... sounds... smells... tastes... tactile sensations; my consciousness will not be dependent on tactile sensations.' ... 'I won't cling to ideas; my consciousness will not be dependent on ideas.' That's how you should train yourself.
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|7| "Then, householder, you should train yourself in this way: 'I won't cling to eye-consciousness... ear-consciousness... nose-consciousness... tongue-consciousness... body-consciousness; my consciousness will not be dependent on body-consciousness.' ... 'I won't cling to intellect-consciousness; my consciousness will not be dependent on intellect-consciousness.' That's how you should train yourself.
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|8| "Then, householder, you should train yourself in this way: 'I won't cling to contact at the eye... contact at the ear... contact at the nose... contact at the tongue... contact at the body; my consciousness will not be dependent on contact at the body.' ... 'I won't cling to contact at the intellect; my consciousness will not be dependent on contact at the intellect.' That's how you should train yourself.
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|9| "Then, householder, you should train yourself in this way: 'I won't cling to feeling born of contact at the eye... feeling born of contact at the ear... feeling born of contact at the nose... feeling born of contact at the tongue... feeling born of contact at the body; my consciousness will not be dependent on feeling born of contact at the body.' ... 'I won't cling to feeling born of contact at the intellect; my consciousness will not be dependent on feeling born of contact at the intellect.' That's how you should train yourself.
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|10| "Then, householder, you should train yourself in this way: 'I won't cling to the earth property... liquid property... fire property... wind property... space property; my consciousness will not be dependent on the space property.' ... 'I won't cling to the consciousness property; my consciousness will not be dependent on the consciousness property.' That's how you should train yourself.
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|11| "Then, householder, you should train yourself in this way: 'I won't cling to form... feeling... perception... thought-fabrications; my consciousness will not be dependent on thought-fabrications.' ... 'I won't cling to consciousness; my consciousness will not be dependent on consciousness.' That's how you should train yourself.
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|12| "Then, householder, you should train yourself in this way: 'I won't cling to the dimension of the infinitude of space... the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness... the dimension of nothingness; my consciousness will not be dependent on the dimension of nothingness.' ... 'I won't cling to the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception; my consciousness will not be dependent on the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception.' That's how you should train yourself.
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|13| "Then, householder, you should train yourself in this way: 'I won't cling to this world; my consciousness will not be dependent on this world... I won't cling to the world beyond; my consciousness will not be dependent on the world beyond.' That's how you should train yourself.
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|14| "Then, householder, you should train yourself in this way: 'I won't cling to what is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, pondered by the intellect; my consciousness will not be dependent on that.' That's how you should train yourself."
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|15| When this was said, Anathapindika the householder wept and shed tears. Ven. Ananda said to him, "Are you sinking, householder? Are you foundering?" "No, venerable sir. I'm not sinking, nor am I foundering. It's just that for a long time I have attended to the Teacher, and to the monks who inspire my heart, but never before have I heard a talk on the Dhamma like this." "This sort of talk on the Dhamma, householder, is not given to lay people clad in white. This sort of talk on the Dhamma is given to those gone forth."
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|16| "In that case, Ven. Sariputta, please let this sort of talk on the Dhamma be given to lay people clad in white. There are clansmen with little dust in their eyes who are wasting away through not hearing [this] Dhamma. There will be those who will understand it."
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|17| Then Ven. Sariputta and Ven. Ananda, having given this instruction to Anathapindika the householder, got up from their seats and left. Then, not long after they left, Anathapindika the householder died and reappeared in the Tusita heaven. Then Anathapindika the deva's son, in the far extreme of the night, his extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta's Grove, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, bowed down to him and stood to one side. As he was standing there, he addressed the Blessed One with this verse:
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|18| This blessed Jeta's Grove, home to the community of seers, where there dwells the Dhamma King: the source of rapture for me. Action, clear-knowing, & mental qualities,[1] virtue, the highest [way of] life:     through this are mortals purified,     not through clan or wealth.
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|19| Thus the wise, seeing their own benefit, investigating the Dhamma appropriately, should purify themselves right there. As for Sariputta:  any monk who has gone beyond,  at best can only equal him  in discernment, virtue, & calm.
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|20| That is what Anathapindika the deva's son said. The Teacher approved. Then Anathapindika the deva's son, [knowing,] "The Teacher has approved of me," bowed down to him, circled him three times, keeping him to his right, and then disappeared right there.
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|21| Then when the night had past, The Blessed One addressed the monks: "Last night, monks, a certain deva's son in the far extreme of the night, his extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta's Grove, came to me and, on arrival, bowed down to me and stood to one side. As he was standing there, he addressed me with this verse:
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|22| This blessed Jeta's Grove, home to the community of seers, where there dwells the Dhamma King:     the source of rapture for me. Action, clear-knowing, & mental qualities, virtue, the highest [way of] life:     through this are mortals purified,  not through clan or wealth.
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|23| Thus the wise, seeing their own benefit, investigating the Dhamma appropriately, should purify themselves right there. As for Sariputta: any monk who has gone beyond,  at best can only equal him  in discernment, virtue, & calm.
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|24| "That is what the deva's son said. And [thinking], 'The Teacher has approved of me,' he bowed down to me, circled me three times, and then disappeared right there."
Instructions to Anathapindika|1|25| When this was said, Ven. Ananda said to the Blessed One, "Lord, that must have been Anathapindika the deva's son. Anathapindika the householder had supreme confidence in Ven. Sariputta." "Very good, Ananda. Very good, to the extent that you have deduced what can be arrived at through logic. That was Anathapindika the deva's son, and no one else." That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, Ven. Ananda delighted in the Blessed One's words.
The Discourse on the Not-self Characteristic|1|1| I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Varanasi in the Game Refuge at Isipatana. There he addressed the group of five monks: "Form, monks, is not self. If form were the self, this form would not lend itself to disease. It would be possible to say with regard to form, 'Let this form be thus. Let this form not be thus.' But precisely because form is not self, form lends itself to disease. And it is not possible to say with regard to form, 'Let this form be thus. Let this form not be thus.' "Feeling is not self... "Perception is not self... "Mental fabrications are not self... "Consciousness is not self. If consciousness were the self, this consciousness would not lend itself to disease. It would be possible to say with regard to consciousness, 'Let my consciousness be thus. Let my consciousness not be thus.' But precisely because consciousness is not self, consciousness lends itself to disease. And it is not possible to say with regard to consciousness, 'Let my consciousness be thus. Let my consciousness not be thus.' "What do you think, monks -- Is form constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord." "And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?" "Stressful, lord." "And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as: 'this is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?" "No, lord." "...Is feeling constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."... "...Is perception constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."... "...Are fabrications constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."... "What do you think, monks -- Is consciousness constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord." "And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?" "Stressful, lord." "And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as: 'this is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?" "No, lord." "Thus, monks, any body whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or external; latent or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: every body is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as: 'this is not mine. This is not my self. This is not what I am.' "Any feeling whatsoever... "Any perception whatsoever... "Any fabrications whatsoever... "Any consciousness whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as: 'this is not mine. This is not my self. This is not what I am.' "Seeing thus, the instructed noble disciple grows disenchanted with the body, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception, disenchanted with fabrications, disenchanted with consciousness. Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is fully released. With full release, there is the knowledge, 'Fully released.' He discerns that 'Birth is depleted, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing! Further for this world.'" That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the group of five monks delighted at his words. And while this explanation was being given, the hearts of the group of five monks, through not clinging not being sustained, were fully released from fermentation/effluents.
The Discourse on the Not-self Characteristic|1|2| I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Varanasi in the Game Refuge at Isipatana. There he addressed the group of five monks:
The Discourse on the Not-self Characteristic|1|3| "The body, monks, is not self. If the body were the self, this body would not lend itself to disease.

And it is not possible (to say) with regard to consciousness, 'Let my consciousness be thus. Let my consciousness not be thus.'
The Discourse on the Not-self Characteristic|1|8| "How do you construe thus, monks -- Is the body constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord." "And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?" "Stressful, lord." "And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as: 'this is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?" "No, lord."

And while this explanation was being given, the hearts of the group of five monks, through lack of clinging, were released from the mental effluents.
At Andhakavinda|1|1| On one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Magadhans at Andhakavinda. Then Ven. Ananda went to him and, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him, "Ananda, the new monks -- those who have not long gone forth, who are newcomers in this Dhamma and Discipline -- should be encouraged, exhorted, and established in these five things. Which five?
At Andhakavinda|1|2| "'Come, friends, be virtuous. Dwell restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha, consummate in your behavior and sphere of activity. Train yourselves, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the slightest faults.' Thus they should be encouraged, exhorted, and established in restraint in accordance with the Patimokkha.
At Andhakavinda|1|3| "'Come, friends, dwell with your sense faculties guarded, with mindfulness as your protector, with mindfulness as your chief, with your intellect self-protected, endowed with an awareness protected by mindfulness.' Thus they should be encouraged, exhorted, and established in restraint of the senses.
At Andhakavinda|1|4| "'Come, friends, speak only a little, place limits on your conversation.' Thus they should be encouraged, exhorted, and established in limited conversation.
At Andhakavinda|1|5| "'Come, friends, dwell in the wilderness. Resort to remote wilderness and forest dwellings.' Thus they should be encouraged, exhorted, and established in physical seclusion.
At Andhakavinda|1|6| "Come, friends, develop right view. Be endowed with right vision.' Thus they should be encouraged, exhorted, and established in right vision.
At Andhakavinda|1|7| "New monks -- those who have not long gone forth, who are newcomers in this Dhamma and Discipline -- should be encouraged, exhorted, and established in these five things."
Conducive to the Imperturbable|1|1| I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in the Kuru country. Now there is a town of the Kurus called Kammasadhamma. There the Blessed One addressed the monks: "Monks!" "Yes, lord," the monks responded.
Conducive to the Imperturbable|1|2| The Blessed One said: "Monks, sensuality is inconstant, hollow, vain, deceptive. It is illusory, the babble of fools. Sensuality here and now; sensuality in lives to come; sensual perceptions here and now; sensual perceptions in lives to come: both are Mara's realm, Mara's domain, Mara's bait, Mara's range. They lead to these evil, unskillful mental states: greed, ill will, and contentiousness. They arise for the obstruction of a disciple of the noble ones here in training.
Conducive to the Imperturbable|1|3| "In that case, the disciple of the noble ones considers this: 'Sensuality here and now; sensuality in lives to come; sensual perceptions here and now; sensual perceptions in lives to come: both are Mara's realm, Mara's domain, Mara's bait, Mara's range. They lead to these evil, unskillful mental states: greed, ill will, and contentiousness. They arise for the obstruction of a disciple of the noble ones here in training. What if I -- overpowering the world [of the five senses] and having determined my mind -- were to dwell with an awareness that was abundant and enlarged? Having done so, these evil, unskillful mental states -- greed, ill will, and contentiousness -- would not come into being. With their abandoning, my mind would become unlimited, immeasurable, and well developed.' Practicing and frequently abiding in this way, his mind acquires confidence in that dimension. There being full confidence, he either attains the imperturbable [1] now or else is committed to discernment. With the break-up of the body, after death, it's possible that this leading-on consciousness of his will go to the imperturbable. This is declared to be the first practice conducive to the imperturbable.
Conducive to the Imperturbable|1|4| "Then again, the disciple of the noble ones considers this: 'Sensuality here and now; sensuality in lives to come; sensual perceptions here and now; sensual perceptions in lives to come: whatever is form, every form, is the four great elements or a form derived from the four great elements.'

Conducive to the Imperturbable|1|10| When this was said, Ven. Ananda said to the Blessed One: "There is the case, lord, where a monk, having practiced in this way -- 'It should not be, it should not occur to me; it will not be, it will not occur to me. What is, what has come to be, that I abandon' -- obtains equanimity. Now, would this monk be totally unbound, or not?"

"There is the case, Ananda, where a monk, having practiced in this way -- (thinking) 'It should not be, it should not occur to me; it will not be, it will not occur to me. What is, what has come to be, that I abandon' -- obtains equanimity. He relishes that equanimity, welcomes it, remains fastened to it. As he relishes that equanimity, welcomes it, remains fastened to it, his consciousness is dependent on it, is sustained by it (clings to it). With clinging/sustenance, Ananda, a monk is not totally unbound."
Conducive to the Imperturbable|1|12| "Being sustained, where is that monk sustained?" "The dimension of neither perception nor non-perception." "Then, indeed, being sustained, he is sustained by the supreme sustenance." "Being sustained, Ananda, he is sustained by the supreme sustenance; for this -- the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception -- is the supreme sustenance. There is [however] the case where a monk, having practiced in this way -- 'It should not be, it should not occur to me; it will not be, it will not occur to me. What is, what has come to be, that I abandon' -- obtains equanimity. He does not relish that equanimity, does not welcome it, does not remain fastened to it. As does not relish that equanimity, does not welcome it, does not remain fastened to it, his consciousness is not dependent on it, is not sustained by it (does not cling to it). Without clinging/sustenance, Ananda, a monk is totally unbound."
Conducive to the Imperturbable|1|13| "It's amazing, lord. It's astounding. For truly, the Blessed One has declared to us the way to cross over the flood by going from one support to the next. But what is the noble liberation?" "There is the case, Ananda, where a disciple of the noble ones considers this: 'Sensuality here and now; sensuality in lives to come; sensual perceptions here and now; sensual perceptions in lives to come; forms here and now; forms in lives to come; form-perceptions here and now; form-perceptions in lives to come; perceptions of the imperturbable; perceptions of the dimension of nothingness; perceptions of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception: that is an identity, to the extent that there is an identity. This is deathless: the liberation of the mind through lack of clinging/sustenance.'
Conducive to the Imperturbable|1|14| "Now, Ananda, I have taught the practice conducive to the imperturbable. I have taught the practice conducive to the dimension of nothingness. I have taught the practice conducive to the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. I have taught the way to cross over the flood by going from one support to the next, the noble liberation. Whatever a teacher should do -- seeking the welfare of his disciples, out of sympathy for them -- that have I done for you. Over there are the roots of trees; over there, empty dwellings. Practice jhana, Ananda. Don't be heedless. Don't later fall into regret. This is our message to you all." That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, Ven. Ananda delighted in the Blessed One's words.
