aS' This is the one and only way, monks, for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the extinguishing of suffering and grief, for walking on the path of truth, for the realisation of nibb\xc4\x81na: that is to say, the fourfold establishing of awareness. Which four? Here, monks, a monk dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, observing body in body, having removed craving and aversion towards the world [of mind and matter]; he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, observing sensations in sensations, having removed craving and aversion towards the world [of mind and matter]; he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, observing mind in mind, having removed craving and aversion towards the world [of mind and matter]; he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, observing mental contents in mental contents, having removed craving and aversion towards the world [of mind and matter].'
p103
aS' Section on Respiration: And how, monks, does a monk dwell observing body in body? Here a monk, having gone into the forest, or to the foot of a tree, or to an empty room, sits down cross-legged, keeps his body upright and fixes his awareness in the area around the mouth.

Whenever one, monks, is affected by various kinds of loss and misfortune, that are followed by this or that kind of painful state of mind, by wailing and crying, by lamentation, by deep wailing, by deep lamentation, by the state of deep wailing and deep lamentation - this, monks, is called lamentation. And what, monks, is pain? If there is, monks, any kind of bodily pain, any kind of bodily unpleasantness or any kind of painful or unpleasant sensation as a result of bodily contact - this, monks, is called pain. And what, monks, is grief? If there is, monks, any kind of mental pain, any kind of mental unpleasantness or any kind of painful or unpleasant sensation as a result of mental contact - this, monks, is called grief. And what, monks, is distress? Whenever one, monks, is affected by various kinds of loss and misfortune, that are followed by this or that kind of painful state of mind, by tribulation, by distress, affliction with distress and affliction with great distress - this, monks, is called distress. And what, monks, is the suffering of being associated with what one does not like? Wherever and whenever one finds unpleasant, disagreeable or disliked objects of sight, sound, smell, taste, touch or of the mind, or, whenever and wherever one finds that there are wishers of one\xe2\x80\x99s own misfortune, harm, difficulties or of one\xe2\x80\x99s own insecurity; if one gets associated, one meets, one comes into contact or gets combined with them - this, monks, is called the suffering of being associated with what one does not like. And what, monks, is the suffering of being disassociated with what one does like? Wherever and whenever one finds pleasant, agreeable or liked objects of sight, sound, smell, taste, touch or of the mind, or, whenever and wherever one finds that there are wishers of one\xe2\x80\x99s own fortune, prosperity, comfort or of one\xe2\x80\x99s own security, like mother and father, like brother and sister, like friends and colleagues or relatives; if one gets disassociated, one does not meet, one does not come into contact or does not get combined with them - this, monks, is called the suffering of being disassociated with what one does like. And what, monks, is not getting what one desires? In beings, monks, who are subject to birth the desire arises: "Oh, truly, that we were not subject to birth! Oh, truly, may there be no new birth for us!" But this cannot be obtained by mere desire; and not to get what one wants is suffering. In beings, monks, who are subject to old age the desire arises: "Oh, truly, that we were not subject to old age! Oh, truly, may we not be subject to old age!" But this cannot be obtained by mere desire; and not to get what one wants is suffering. In beings, monks, who are subject to sickness the desire arises: "Oh, truly, that we were not subject to sickness! Oh, truly, may there be no sickness for us!" But this cannot be obtained by mere desire; and not to get what one wants is suffering. In beings, monks, who are subject to death the desire arises: "Oh, truly, that we were not subject to death! Oh, truly, may we never have to die!" But this cannot be obtained by mere desire; and not to get what one wants is suffering. In beings, monks, who are subject to sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and distress the desire arises: "Oh, truly, that we were not subject to sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and distress! Oh, truly, may we not suffer from sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and distress!" But this cannot be obtained by mere desire; and not to get what one wants is suffering. And how, monks, in short, is clinging to the five aggregates suffering? It is as follows - clinging to the aggregate of matter is suffering, clinging to the aggregate of sensation is suffering, clinging to the aggregate of perception is suffering, clinging to the aggregate of reaction is suffering, clinging to the aggregate of consciousness is suffering. This, monks, in short, is called suffering because of clinging to these five aggregates. This, monks, is the Noble Truth of Suffering.'

p119
aS' And what, monks, is the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering? It is this, the Noble Eightfold Path, namely: right understanding, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right awareness and right concentration. And what, monks, is Right Understanding? It is this, monks: the knowledge of suffering, the knowledge of the arising of suffering, the knowledge of the cessation of suffering, the knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of suffering. This, monks, is called Right Understanding. And what, monks, is Right Thought? Thoughts of renunciation, thoughts that are free from aversion and thoughts that are free from violence. This, monks, is called Right Thought. And what, monks, is Right Speech? Abstaining from lying, abstaining from slander and backbiting, abstaining from harsh words and abstaining from frivolous talk. This, monks, is called Right Speech. And what, monks, is Right Action? Abstaining from killing, abstaining from taking what has not been given and abstaining from sexual misconduct. This, monks, is called Right Action. And what, monks, is Right Livelihood? Here, monks, a noble disciple having given up wrong ways of livelihood earns his livelihood by right means. This, monks, is called Right Livelihood. And what, monks, is Right Effort? Here, monks, a monk generates the will to prevent the arising of unarisen evil unwholesome mental states; he makes strong effort, stirs up his energy, applies his mind to it and strives. To eradicate those evil unwholesome mental states that have arisen in him, he generates the will, makes strong effort, stirs up his energy, applies his mind to it and strives. To develop wholesome mental states that have not yet arisen in him, he generates will, makes strong effort, stirs up his energy, applies his mind to it and strives. To maintain wholesome mental states that have arisen in him, not to let them fade away, to multiply them and bring them to full maturity and to full development, he generates will, makes strong effort, stirs up his energy, applies his mind to it and strives. This, monks, is called Right Effort. And what, monks, is Right Awareness? Here, monks, a monk dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, observing body in body, having removed craving and aversion towards the world [of mind and matter]; he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, observing sensations in sensations, having removed craving and aversion towards the world [of mind and matter]; he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, observing mind in mind, having removed craving and aversion towards the world [of mind and matter]; he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, observing mental contents in mental contents, having removed craving and aversion towards the world [of mind and matter]. This, monks, is called Right Awareness. And what, monks, is right concentration? Here monks, a monk, detached from craving, detached from unwholesome mental states, enters into the first absorption, born of detachment, accompanied by initial and sustained application of the mind and filled with rapture and bliss and he dwells therein. With the subsiding of initial and sustained application of the mind and gaining inner tranquillity and oneness of mind he enters into the second absorption, born of concentration, free from initial and sustained application of the mind, filled with rapture and bliss and he dwells therein. After the fading away of rapture he dwells in equanimity, aware with constant thorough understanding of impermanence, and he experiences in his body the bliss of which the noble ones say: "That bliss is experienced by one with equanimity and awareness." Thus he enters the third absorption and dwells therein. After the eradication of pleasure and pain and with joy and grief having previously passed away, he enters into a state beyond pleasure and pain, the fourth absorption, that is totally purified by equanimity and awareness and he dwells therein. This, monks, is called Right Concentration. This, monks, is the Noble Truth of the Path leading to the Cessation of Suffering.'
p120
aS' Thus he dwells observing mental contents in mental contents internally, or he dwells observing mental contents in mental contents externally, or he dwells observing mental contents in mental contents both internally and externally. Thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of arising in the mental contents, thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of passing away in the mental contents, thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of arising and passing away in the mental contents. Now his awareness is established: "These are mental contents!" Thus he develops his awareness to such an extent that there is mere understanding along with mere awareness. In this way he dwells detached, without clinging towards anything in the world [of mind and matter]. This is how, monks, a monk dwells observing mental contents in mental contents as regards the Four Noble Truths.'
p121
aS' Indeed, monks, whoever practises this fourfold establishing of awareness in this manner for seven years, he may expect one of two results: in this very life highest wisdom or, if a substratum of aggregates remains, the stage of non-returner. Let alone seven years, monks. Should any person practise this fourfold establishing of awareness in this manner for six years, one of two results may be expected in him: in this very life highest wisdom or, if a substratum of aggregates remains, the stage of non-returner. Let alone six years, monks... Let alone five years, monks... Let alone four years, monks... Let alone three years, monks... Let alone two years, monks... Let alone one year, monks. Should any person practise this fourfold establishing of awareness in this manner for seven months, one of two results may be expected in him: in this very life highest wisdom or, if a substratum of aggregates remains, the stage of non-returner. Let alone seven months, monks... Let alone six months, monks... Let alone five months, monks... Let alone four months, monks... Let alone three months, monks... Let alone two months, monks... Let alone one month, monks... Let alone half a month, monks... Let alone half a month, monks. Should any person practise this fourfold establishing of awareness in this manner for seven days, one of two results may be expected in him: in this very life highest wisdom or, if a substratum of aggregates remains, the stage of non-returner. It is for this reason that it was said: "This is the one and only way, monks, for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the extinguishing of suffering and grief, for walking on the path of truth, for the realisation of nibb\xc4\x81na: that is to say, the fourfold establishing of awareness." Thus the Enlightened One spoke. Glad in heart, the monks welcomed the words of the Enlightened One.'

aS' I hear tell: Once Upon A Time, The Lucky Man, Savatthi-Town, East-Park, The Palace of Migara\xe2\x80\x99s Mother came-a-visiting. At this time, Ananda, just emerging from his afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s sit down practice, went to the Teacher, greeted him, and sat down to one side. There he said: Sir, at one time, The Lucky Man was residing among the Sakyans in the market town of Nagaraka, and I, also, was there. In that place, I recall having heard, learnt, studied, grasped, face-to-face with the Lucky Man, this statement made by him: "At this time, Ananda, I reside in the fullness of emptiness." Did I hear this correctly?'
p123
aS' Yes, Ananda, you heard, learnt, studied, grasped this correctly. Previously, as well as now, I reside in the fullness of emptiness. In the same way, Ananda, as this Palace of Migara\xe2\x80\x99s Mother [1] is empty of the disturbances of the city: empty of elephants, cows, horses, asses; empty of dealings with gold and silver; empty of groups of men and women, and there is only this that remains to disturb the emptiness: that is, the vibration emanating off the beggars here; in the same way, a beggar, paying no attention to the disturbances of the city, paying no attention to human beings, pays attention only to the vibration emanating off the forest. He takes to paying attention only to perception of the forest, and cleans out, tidies up and liberates his mind.'
p124
aS' He understands: "This way there is no disturbance emanating from perception of the city. This way there is no disturbance emanating from perception of human beings. This way there is only that disturbance which emanates off perception of the forest." Thus: "This way is empty of disturbance emanating from perception of the city. This way is empty of disturbance emanating from perception of human beings. This way there is only this that disturbs the emptiness: that is, the vibration which emanates off perception of the forest." In this way he regards that which is present as empty of that which is not present; and, with regard to what remains, he understands that: \xe2\x80\x98That being; this is.\xe2\x80\x99'
p125
aS' Thus, Ananda, there is in the case of this case, a sitting-down-to-empty-out that results in surpassing purity. And again, Ananda, deeper than that, paying no attention to human beings, paying no attention to the forest, he takes to paying attention only to perception of earth, and cleans out, tidies up and liberates his mind. In the same way as he would regard a bull\xe2\x80\x99s hide, stretched out to cure, held down by a hundred pegs, it\xe2\x80\x99s life done gone; when he pays attention to earth, he does not think about anything on earth such as dry land or rivers or swamps or marshes with plants with branches and thorns or mountains or plains, but he only just pays attention to the vibration which emanates off perception of earth. He takes to paying attention only to perception of earth, and cleans out, tidies up and liberates his mind.'

At a time the Bhikkhus mindfulness is established, the enlightenment factor mindfulness is established to the Bhikkhu, at that time the Bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor mindfulness and completes it.

p158
aS" I heard thus: At one time the Blessed One was living in the Kuru country, in the hamlet named Kammassadhamma. The Blessed One addressed the Bhikkhus from there. 'Bhikkhus, sensuality is impermanent, useless, false, a stupid thing and a deception. It is prattle and foolish talk. Sensuality here and now and hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, all these are the domain of death, the pasture of death. The evil mind with sensuality is led to greed, anger and quarrels Bhikkhus the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality is impermanent, useless, false, a stupid thing and a deception. It is prattle and foolish talk. Sensuality here and now and hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, all these are the domain of death, the pasture of death. The evil mind with sensuality is led to greed, anger and quarrels. What if I develop the mind grown great and much, above the material world, then there will be no greed, anger, or quarrels. When these are dispelled my mind will be significant, limitless and well developed. Fallen to this method, when developed much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere or abides in imperturbability here and now, or with wisdom it is released. After death, there is a possibility that the led on, consciousness should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, I say, this is the first suitability to reach imperturbability."
p159
aS' Again Bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now and hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever matter of the four primary elements, is on account of this held on matter. Fallen to this method, when developed much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere or abides in imperturbability here and now, or with wisdom it is released. After death, there is a possibility that the led on, consciousness should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, I say, this is the second suitability to reach imperturbability.'
p160
aS' Again Bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now and hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever matter, here and now or hereafter, whatever material perceptions here and now and here after, all these are impermanent. It is not suitable to take pleasure and appropriate what is impermanent. Fallen to this method, when developed much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere or abides in imperturbability here and now, or with wisdom it is released. After death, there is a possibility that this led on, consciousness should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, this is the third suitability to reach imperturbability, I say.'
p161
aS' Again Bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now and hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever matter, here and now or hereafter, whatever material perceptions here and now and here after and the perception of imperturbability, all these perceptions cease in this sphere of nothingness, without a remainder. It is peaceful and exalted. Fallen to this method, when developed much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere or abides in imperturbability here and now, or with wisdom it is released. After death, there is a possibility that this led on, consciousness should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, I say, this is the first suitability to reach the sphere of nothingness.'
p162
aS' Again, Bhikkhus, the noble disciple gone to the forest or to the root of a tree reflects. All these are perceived things, of the self, or of the belongings of the self. Fallen to this method, when developed much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere or abides in imperturbability here and now, or with wisdom it is released. After death, there is a possibility that this led on consciousness should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, I say, this is the second suitability to reach the sphere of nothingness. Again, Bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects, I have no greed, hate or delusion for anybody, neither is there greed, hate and delusion to me from anyone. Fallen to this method, when developed much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere or abides in imperturbability here and now, or with wisdom it is released. After death, there is a possibility that this led on consciousness should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, I say, this is the third suitability to reach the sphere of nothingness.'
p163
aS" Again Ananda, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now and hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever matter, here and now or hereafter, whatever material perceptions here and now and here after, the perception of imperturbability and the perception of nothingness, all these perceptions cease in this sphere of neither perception nor non-perception, without a remainder. It is peaceful and exalted. Fallen to this method, when developed much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere or abides in neither perception nor non perception here and now, or with wisdom it is released. After death, there is a possibility that this led on, consciousness should reach the sphere of neither perception nor non perception. Bhikkhus, I say, this is suitability to reach the sphere of neither perception nor non perception.'"
p164
aS" Then venerable Ananda said. 'Venerable sir, the Bhikkhu falls to this method, there is not, there is not to me, there will not be, there will not be to me, whatever there is, whatever produced, I discard, thus he gains equanimity. Venerable sir, is that Bhikkhu extinguished?' 'Ananda, a certain Bhikkhu fallen to this method may extinguish, another would not.' 'Venerable sir, why should a certain Bhikkhu fallen to this method extinguish and another not extinguish?' 'Ananda, the Bhikkhu falls to this method, there is not, there is not to me, there will not be, there will not be to me, whatever there is, whatever produced, I discard, thus he gains equanimity. He delights in that equanimity, welcomes it, tied to it, his consciousness settles in it. Ananda, the Bhikkhu with settlements does not extinguish.'"
p165
aS" 'Venerable sir, where does the Bhikkhu settle?' 'Ananda, in neither-perception-nor-non-perception.' 'Venerable sir, he settles in the highest settlement.' 'Ananda, of settlements neither-perception-nor non-perception, is the highest settlement Ananda, the Bhikkhu falls to this method, there is not, there is not to me, there will not be, there will not be to me, whatever there is, whatever produced, I discard, thus he gains equanimity. He does not delight in that equanimity, does not welcome it, not tied to it his consciousness does not settle in it. Ananda, the Bhikkhu without settlements is extinguished.' 'Wonderful, venerable sir, the Blessed One has explained the crossing of the flood supported on higher and higher spheres. Venerable sir, how is noble release?'"
p166
aS" 'Again Ananda, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now and hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever matter, here and now or hereafter, whatever material perceptions here and now and here after, the perception of imperturbability, the perception of nothingness, and the sphere of neither perception nor non perception, these are things of the self and are holdings, that mind without holdings is the mind's release. Ananda, I have taught you the method to attain, imperturbability, the sphere of nothingness, the sphere of neither perception-nor-non-perception, the method of crossing the flood supported on higher and higher spheres and the noble release. Whatever a teacher should do to his disciples out of compassion, that I have done to you. Ananda, these are the roots of trees, and these are the empty houses. Ananda, concentrate and do not have remorse later. This is our advice to you. The Blessed One said those words and those Bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One."

aS' "Monks, these two slander the Tath\xc3\xa1gata. Which two? He who explains what was not said or spoken by the Tath\xc3\xa1gata as said or spoken by the Tath\xc3\xa1gata and he who explains what was said or spoken by the Tath\xc3\xa1gata as not said or spoken by the Tath\xc3\xa1gata. These are two who slander the Tath\xc3\xa1gata."'

aS' I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels\' Sanctuary. Then Prince Abhaya went to Nigantha Nataputta and on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, Nigantha Nataputta said to him, "Come, now, prince. Refute the words of the contemplative Gotama, and this admirable report about you will spread afar: \'The words of the contemplative Gotama -- so mighty, so powerful -- were refuted by Prince Abhaya!\'"'
p169
aS' "But how, venerable sir, will I refute the words of the contemplative Gotama -- so mighty, so powerful?" "Come now, prince. Go to the contemplative Gotama and on arrival say this: \'Venerable sir, would the Tath\xc3\xa1gata say words that are un-endearing and disagreeable to others?\' If the contemplative Gotama, thus asked, answers, \'The Tath\xc3\xa1gata would say words that are un-endearing and disagreeable to others,\' then you should say, \'Then how is there any difference between you, venerable sir, and run-of-the-mill people? For even run-of-the-mill people say words that are un-endearing and disagreeable to others.\' But if the contemplative Gotama, thus asked, answers, \'The Tath\xc3\xa1gata would not say words that are un-endearing and disagreeable to others,\' then you should say, \'Then how, venerable sir, did you say of Devadatta that "Devadatta is headed for destitution, Devadatta is headed for hell, Devadatta will boil for an eon, Devadatta is incurable"? '
p170
aS' For Devadatta was upset and disgruntled at those words of yours.\' When the contemplative Gotama is asked this two-pronged question by you, he won\'t be able to swallow it down or spit it up. Just as if a two-horned chestnut [1] were stuck in a man\'s throat: he would not be able to swallow it down or spit it up. In the same way, when the contemplative Gotama is asked this two-pronged question by you, he won\'t be able to swallow it down or spit it up."'
p171
aS' Responding, "As you say, venerable sir," Prince Abhaya got up from his seat, bowed down to Nigantha Nataputta, circumambulated him, and then went to the Blessed One. On arrival, he bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he glanced up at the sun and thought, "Today is not the time to refute the Blessed One\'s words. Tomorrow in my own home I will overturn the Blessed One\'s words." So he said to the Blessed One, "May the Blessed One, together with three others, acquiesce to my offer of tomorrow\'s meal."'
p172
aS' The Blessed One acquiesced with silence. Then Prince Abhaya, understanding the Blessed One\'s acquiescence, got up from his seat, bowed down to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and left. Then, after the night had passed, the Blessed One early in the morning put on his robes and, carrying his bowl and outer robe, went to Prince Abhaya\'s home. On arrival, he sat down on a seat made ready. Prince Abhaya, with his own hand, served and satisfied the Blessed One with fine staple and non-staple foods. Then, when the Blessed One had eaten and had removed his hand from his bowl, Prince Abhaya took a lower seat and sat down to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, "Venerable sir, would the Tath\xc3\xa1gata say words that are un-endearing and disagreeable to others?" "Prince, there is no categorical yes-or-no answer to that." "Then right here, venerable sir, the Niganthas are destroyed." "But prince, why do you say, \'then right here, venerable sir, the Niganthas are destroyed\'?" "Just yesterday, venerable sir, I went to Nigantha Nataputta and... he said to me...\'Come now, prince. Go to the contemplative Gotama and on arrival say this: "Venerable sir, would the Tath\xc3\xa1gata say words that are un-endearing and disagreeable to others?"... Just as if a two-horned chestnut were stuck in a man\'s throat: he would not be able to swallow it down or spit it up. In the same way, when the contemplative Gotama is asked this two-pronged question by you, he won\'t be able to swallow it down or spit it up.\'"'
p173
aS' Now at that time a baby boy was lying face-up on the prince\'s lap. So the Blessed One said to the prince, "What do you think, prince: If this young boy, through your own negligence or that of the nurse, were to take a stick or a piece of gravel into its mouth, what would you do?" "I would take it out, venerable sir. If I couldn\'t get it out right away, then holding its head in my left hand and crooking a finger of my right, I would take it out, even if it meant drawing blood. Why is that? Because I have sympathy for the young boy." "In the same way, prince: [1] In the case of words that the Tath\xc3\xa1gata knows to be un-factual, untrue, unbeneficial (or: not connected with the goal), un-endearing and disagreeable to others, he does not say them. [2] In the case of words that the Tath\xc3\xa1gata knows to be factual, true, unbeneficial, un-endearing and disagreeable to others, he does not say them. [3] In the case of words that the Tath\xc3\xa1gata knows to be factual, true, beneficial, but un-endearing and disagreeable to others, he has a sense of the proper time for saying them. [4] In the case of words that the Tath\xc3\xa1gata knows to be un-factual, untrue, unbeneficial, but endearing and agreeable to others, he does not say them. [5] In the case of words that the Tath\xc3\xa1gata knows to be factual, true, unbeneficial, but endearing and agreeable to others, he does not say them. [6] In the case of words that the Tath\xc3\xa1gata knows to be factual, true, beneficial, and endearing and agreeable to others, he has a sense of the proper time for saying them. Why is that? Because the Tath\xc3\xa1gata has sympathy for living beings."'
p174
aS' "Venerable sir, when wise nobles or priests, householders or contemplatives, having formulated questions, come to the Tath\xc3\xa1gata and ask him, does this line of reasoning appear to his awareness beforehand -- \'If those who approach me ask this, I -- thus asked -- will answer in this way\' -- or does the Tath\xc3\xa1gata come up with the answer on the spot?" "In that case, prince, I will ask you a counter-question. Answer as you see fit. What do you think: are you skilled in the parts of a chariot?" "Yes, venerable sir. I am skilled in the parts of a chariot." "And what do you think: When people come and ask you, \'What is the name of this part of the chariot?\' does this line of reasoning appear to your awareness beforehand -- \'If those who approach me ask this, I -- thus asked -- will answer in this way\' -- or do you come up with the answer on the spot?" "Venerable sir, I am renowned for being skilled in the parts of a chariot. All the parts of a chariot are well-known to me. I come up with the answer on the spot." "In the same way, prince, when wise nobles or priests, householders or contemplatives, having formulated questions, come to the Tath\xc3\xa1gata and ask him, he comes up with the answer on the spot. Why is that, because the property of the Dhamma is thoroughly penetrated by the Tath\xc3\xa1gata. From his thorough penetration of the property of the Dhamma, he comes up with the answer on the spot." When this was said, Prince Abhaya said to the Blessed One: "Magnificent, venerable sir! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One -- through many lines of reasoning -- made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of monks. May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life."'
p175
aS' Then Janussoni the Brahman went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "I am of the view and opinion that there is no one who, subject to death, is not afraid or in terror of death."'

"Yes, prince, the Thus Gone One, says words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others." Then you should say. "Venerable sir, what is the difference between you and the ordinary one?

aS' \'He grows disenchanted with the ear... \'He grows disenchanted with the nose... \'He grows disenchanted with the tongue... \'He grows disenchanted with the body...\'He grows disenchanted with the intellect, disenchanted with ideas, disenchanted with mental consciousness, disenchanted with mental contact. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on mental contact, experienced as pleasure, pain, or neither-pleasure-nor-pain: He grows disenchanted with that too. Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is released. With release, there is the knowledge, "Released." He discerns that, "Birth is depleted, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world."\''
p262
aS' That is what the Blessed One said. Glad at heart, the monks delighted at his words. And while this explanation was being given, the hearts of the 1,000 monks, through no clinging (not being sustained), were released from the mental effluents.'
p263
aS' Then Anathapindika the householder went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him: "There are these five benefits that can be obtained from wealth. Which five?'
p264
aS' "There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones -- using the wealth earned through his efforts and enterprise, amassed through the strength of his arm, and piled up through the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained -- provides himself with pleasure and satisfaction, and maintains that pleasure rightly. He provides his mother and father with pleasure and satisfaction, and maintains that pleasure rightly. He provides his children, his wife, his slaves, servants, and assistants with pleasure and satisfaction, and maintains that pleasure rightly. This is the first benefit that can be obtained from wealth.'
p265
aS' "Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones -- using the wealth earned through his efforts and enterprise, amassed through the strength of his arm, and piled up through the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained -- provides his friends and associates with pleasure and satisfaction, and maintains that pleasure rightly. This is the second benefit that can be obtained from wealth.'
p266
aS' "Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones -- using the wealth earned through his efforts and enterprise, amassed through the strength of his arm, and piled up through the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained -- wards off from calamities coming from fire, flood, kings, thieves, or hateful heirs, and keeps himself safe. This is the third benefit that can be obtained from wealth.'
p267
aS' "Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones -- using the wealth earned through his efforts and enterprise, amassed through the strength of his arm, and piled up through the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained -- performs the five oblations: to relatives, guests, the dead, kings, and devas. This is the fourth benefit that can be obtained from wealth. "Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones -- using the wealth earned through his efforts and enterprise, amassed through the strength of his arm, and piled up through the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained -- institutes offerings of supreme aim, heavenly, resulting in happiness, leading to heaven, given to priests and contemplatives who abstain from intoxication and heedlessness, who endure all things with patience and humility, each taming himself, each restraining himself, each taking himself to Unbinding. This is the fifth benefit that can be obtained from wealth.'
p268
aS' "If it so happens that, when a disciple of the noble ones obtains these five benefits from wealth, his wealth goes to depletion, the thought occurs to him, \'Even though my wealth has gone to depletion, I have obtained the five benefits that can be obtained from wealth,\' and he feels no remorse. If it so happens that, when a disciple of the noble ones obtains these five benefits from wealth, his wealth increases, the thought occurs to him, \'I have obtained the five benefits that can be obtained from wealth, and my wealth has increased,\' and he feels no remorse. So he feels no remorse in either case."'
p269
aS" 'My wealth has been enjoyed,\xe2\x80\xa8my dependents supported,\xe2\x80\xa8protected from calamities by me.\xe2\x80\xa8I have given supreme offerings\xe2\x80\xa8and performed the five oblations.\xe2\x80\xa8I have provided for the virtuous,\xe2\x80\xa8the restrained,\xe2\x80\xa8followers of the holy life.\xe2\x80\xa8For whatever aim a wise householder\xe2\x80\xa8would desire wealth,\xe2\x80\xa8that aim I have attained.\xe2\x80\xa8I have done what will not lead to future distress.'\xe2\x80\xa8When this is recollected by a mortal,\xe2\x80\xa8a person established in the Dhamma of the Noble Ones,\xe2\x80\xa8he is praised in this life\xe2\x80\xa8and, after death, rejoices in heaven."
p270
aS' I heard thus: At one time the Blessed One was living in Anathapindika\xe2\x80\x99s monastery, in Jeta\xe2\x80\x99s grove in Savatthi. Then venerable Punna getting up from his seclusion in the evening, approached the Blessed One, worshipped sat on a side and said. \xe2\x80\x98Venerable sir, it is good, if I\xe2\x80\x99m advised in short, so that I could abide alone and secluded, zealous to dispel diligently.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Then Punna, listen, I will advice you.\xe2\x80\x99 Venerable Punna agreed and the Blessed said.'
p271
aS' \xe2\x80\x98Punna, there are pleasing, agreeable, forms cognizable by eye-consciousness, arousing fondness, attachment and sensual desires. The Bhikkhu, delights, welcomes and clings to them, and interest arises. Punna, I say, the arising of interest is the arising of unpleasantness. There are pleasing agreeable sounds cognizable by ear-consciousness, scents cognizable by nose-consciousness, tastes cognizable by tongue consciousness, touches cognizable by body consciousness and ideas cognizable by mind consciousness, arousing fondness, attachment and sensual desires. The Bhikkhu, delights, welcomes and clings to them, and interest arises. Punna, I say, the arising of interest is the arising of unpleasantness.'
p272
aS' Punna, there are pleasing, agreeable, forms, cognizable by eye-consciousness, arousing fondness, attachment and sensual desires. The Bhikkhu, does not delight welcome and cling to them, and the interest ceases. Punna, I say, the cessation of interest is the cessation of unpleasantness. There are pleasing, agreeable, sounds cognizable by ear-consciousness, scents cognizable by nose-consciousness, tastes cognizable by tongue consciousness, touches cognizable by body consciousness and ideas cognizable by mind consciousness, arousing fondness, attachment and sensual desires. The Bhikkhu, does not delight, welcome and cling to them, and so the interest ceases. Punna, I say, the cessation of interest is the cessation of unpleasantness.'
p273
aS' Punna, I have advised you in short. Now in which state will you abide?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Venerable sir, now that I\xe2\x80\x99m advised in short, I will abide in the Sunaparanta state.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Punna, the people of Sunaparanta are rough, if they scold and abuse you, what will you do?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Venerable sir, if the people of Sunaparanta scold and abuse me. It will occur to me, indeed the people of Sunaparanta are good, they do not hurt me with their hands.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Punna, if the people of Sunaparanta hurt you with their hands, what will you do?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Venerable sir, if the people of Sunaparanta hurt me with their hands, it will occur to me, indeed the people of Sunaparanta are good, they do not hurt me with clods.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Punna, if the people of Sunaparanta hurt you with clods, what will you do?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Venerable sir, if the people of Sunaparanta hurt me with clods, it will occur to me, indeed the people of Sunaparanta are good, they do not hurt me with a stick.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Punna, if the people of Sunaparanta hurt you with a stick, what will you do?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Venerable sir, if the people of Sunaparanta hurt me with a stick, it will occur to me, indeed the people of Sunaparanta are good, they do not hurt me with a weapon\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Punna, if the people of Sunaparanta hurt you with a weapon, what will you do?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Venerable sir, if the people of Sunaparanta hurt me with a weapon, it will occur to me, indeed the people of Sunaparanta are good, they do not end my life with a sharp weapon\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Punna, if the people of Sunaparanta put an end to your life with a sharp weapon, what will you do?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Venerable sir, if the people of Sunaparanta would put an end to my life, it will occur to me thus. There are disciples of the Blessed One, who loathing the body and life search for an assassin. Here I have got an assassin even without a search." \xe2\x80\x98Good! Punna, it is possible for you to abide in Sunaparanta endowed with that appeasement in the Teaching. You may do the fit now.\xe2\x80\x99 Venerable Punna, delighting in the words of the Blessed One, got up from his seat, worshipped the Blessed One, and moving with his right side towards the Blessed One showed reverence. Putting his dwelling in order and taking bowl and robes, he left on a tour to Sunaparanta and arrived there in due order. Then he abode in that state. Venerable Punna, during that same rains, brought forth about five hundred male disciples and about five hundred female disciples and realized the three knowledge\xe2\x80\x99s and venerable Punna attained final extinction. Then many Bhikkhus, approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said. \xe2\x80\x98Venerable sir, the clansman who was advised by the Blessed One in short has passed away. What are his movements after death?\xe2\x80\x99'
p274
aS' \xe2\x80\x98Bhikkhus, the clansman Punna is wise. He stood on his own in the Teaching. (*1) He did not worry me about questions in the Teaching. He has attained final extinction.\xe2\x80\x99 The Blessed One said thus and those Bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One.'
p275
aS' "In a guest house, O monks, people from the east may take lodgings, or people from the west, north or south. People from the warrior caste may come and take lodgings there, and also Brahmans, middle class people and menials. "Similarly, O monks, there arise in this body various kinds of feelings; there arise pleasant feelings, painful feelings and neutral feelings; worldly feelings that are pleasant, painful or neutral, and unworldly (spiritual) feelings that are pleasant, painful and neutral."'
p276
aS' Thus have I heard. Once the Lord was staying at Savatthi, at the mansion of Migara\xe2\x80\x99s mother in the East Park. And at that time Vasettha and Bharadvaja were living among the monks, hoping to become monks themselves. And in the evening, the Lord rose from his secluded meditation and came out of the mansion, and started walking up and down in its shade. Vasettha noticed this and he said to Bharadvaja: \xe2\x80\x98Friend Bharadvaja, the Lord has come out and is walking up and down. Let us approach him. We might be fortunate enough to hear a talk on Dhamma from the lord himself.\xe2\x80\x99 Yes, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bharadvaja, so they went up to the lord, saluted him, and fell into step with him.'
p277
aS' Then the lord said to Vasettha: \xe2\x80\x98Vasettha, you two are Brahmins born and bred, and you have gone forth from the household life into homelessness from Brahmin families. Do not the Brahmins revile and abuse you?\xe2\x80\x99'
p278
aS' \xe2\x80\x98Indeed, lord, the Brahmins do revile and abuse us. They don\xe2\x80\x99t hold back with their usual flood of reproaches.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Well, Vasettha, what kind of reproaches do they fling at you?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Lord, what the Brahmins say is this, "The Brahmins caste is the highest caste\xe2\x80\x94other castes are base; the Brahmin caste is fair, other castes are dark; Brahmins are purified, non-Brahmins are not, the Brahmins are the true children of Brahma, [1] born from his mouth, born of Brahma, heirs of Brahma. And you, you have deserted the highest class and gone over to the base class of shave-ling petty ascetics, servants, dark fellows born of Brahma\xe2\x80\x99s Foot! It\xe2\x80\x99s not right, it\xe2\x80\x99s not proper for you to mix with such people!" That is the way the Brahmins abuse us, lord.\xe2\x80\x99'
p279
aS' \xe2\x80\x98Then, Vasettha, the Brahmins have forgotten their ancient tradition when they say that. Because we can see Brahmin women, the wives of Brahmins, who menstruate and become pregnant, have babies, and give milk. And yet these womb-born Brahmins talk about being born from Brahma\xe2\x80\x99s mouth\xe2\x80\xa6These Brahmins misrepresent Brahma, tell lies and earn much demerit.'
p280
aS' \xe2\x80\x98There are, Vasettha, these four castes: The Khattiyas, The Brahmins, the merchants and the artisans. And sometimes a Khattiya takes life, takes what is not given, commits sexual misconduct, tells lies, indulges in slander, harsh speech or idle chatter, is grasping, malicious, or of wrong views. Thus such things as are immoral and considered so, blameworthy and considered so, to be avoided and considered so, ways unbefitting an Ariyan and considered so, black with black result and blamed by the wise, are sometimes to found among the Khattiyas, and the same applies to Brahmins, merchants, and artisans.'
p281
aS' \xe2\x80\x98Sometimes too, a Khattiya refrains from taking life, does not take what is not given, refrains from sexual misconduct, speaks truth, shuns slander, harsh speech or idle chatter, is not grasping, malicious, or of wrong views. Thus such things are moral and considered so, blameless and considered so, to be followed and considered so, ways befitting an Ariyan and considered so, bright with bright results and praised by the wise, are sometimes found among the Khattiyas, and likewise among Brahmins, merchants, and artisans. \xe2\x80\x98Now since both dark and bright qualities, which are blamed and praised by the wise, are scattered indiscriminately among the four castes, the wise do not recognize the claim about the Brahmin caste being the highest. Why is that? Because, Vasettha, anyone from the four castes who becomes a monk, an Arahant who has destroyed the corruptions, who has lived the life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached the highest goal, destroyed the fetter of becoming, and become emancipated through super-knowledge\xe2\x80\x94he is proclaims supreme by virtue of Dhamma and not of non-Dhamma.'
p282
aS' Dhamma is the best thing for people In this life and the next as well. \xe2\x80\x98This illustration will make clear to you how Dhamma is best in this world and the next. King Pasenadi of Kosala knows: "The ascetic Gotama has gone forth from the neighboring clan of the Sakyans." Now the Sakyans are vassals of the King of Kosala. They offer him humble service and salute him, rise and do him homage and pay him fitting service and just as the Sakyans offer the King humble service and salute him, rise and do him homage and pay him fitting service so likewise does the King offer humble service to the Tath\xc3\xa1gata, thinking, "If the ascetic Gotama is well-born, I am ill-born; if the ascetic Gotama is strong, I am weak; if the ascetic Gotama is pleasant to look at, I am ill-favored; if the ascetic Gotama is influential, I am of little influence." Now it is because of honoring the Dhamma, making much of the Dhamma, esteeming the Dhamma, doing reverent homage to the Dhamma that King Pasenadi does humble service to the Tath\xc3\xa1gata and pays him fitting service:'
p283
aS' Dhamma is the best thing for people In this life and the next as well. Vasettha, all of you, though of different birth, name, clan and family, who have gone forth from the household life into homelessness, if you are asked who you are, you should reply: "We are ascetics, followers of the Sakyan." [2] He whose faith in the Tath\xc3\xa1gata is settled, rooted, established, solid, unshakable by any ascetic or Brahmin, any deva or mara or Brahma or anyone in the world, can truly say: "I am a true son of the Blessed Lord, born of his mouth, born of Dhamma, created by Dhamma, an heir of Dhamma." Why is that? Because, Vasettha, this designates the Tath\xc3\xa1gata: "The Body of Dhamma," that is "The Body of Brahma," [3] or "Become Dhamma," that is "Become Brahma." [4] \xe2\x80\x98There comes a time, Vasettha, when, sooner or later after a long period this world contracts. At a time of contraction, beings are mostly born in the Abhassara Brahma world. And there they dwell, mind-made, feeding on delight, self luminous, moving through the air, glorious\xe2\x80\x94and they stay like that for a very long time. But sooner or later, after a very long period, this world begins to expand again. At a time of expansion, the beings from the Abhassara Brahma world, having passed away from there, are mostly reborn in this world. Here they dwell, mind-made, feeding on delight, self-luminous, moving through the air, glorious\xe2\x80\x94[5] and they stay like that for a very long time. \xe2\x80\x98At that period, Vasettha, there was just one mass of water, and all was darkness, blinding darkness. Neither moon or sun appeared, no constellations or stars appeared, night and day were not yet distinguished, nor months and fortnights, nor years and seasons; there was no male and female, beings being reckoned just as beings. [6] And sooner or later, after a very long period of time, savory earth spread itself over the waters where those beings were. It looked just like the skin that forms itself over hot milk as it cools. It was endowed with color, smell, and taste. It was the color of fine ghee or butter and it was very sweet, like pure wild honey. \xe2\x80\x98Then some being of a greedy nature said: "I say, what can this be?" and tasted the savory earth on its finger. In so doing, it became taken with the flavor, and craving arose in it. Then other beings, taking their cue from that one, also tasted the stuff with their fingers. They too were taken with the flavor, and craving arose in them. So they set to with their hands, breaking off pieces of the stuff in order to eat it. And the result was that their self luminance disappeared. And as a result of the disappearance of their self luminance the moon and the sun appeared, night and day were distinguished, months and fortnights appeared, and the year and its seasons. To that extent the world re-evolved.'
p284
aS' \xe2\x80\x98And those beings continued for a very long time feasting on this savory earth, feeding on it and being nourished by it. And as they did so, their bodies became coarser, and a difference in looks developed among them. Some beings became good looking, others ugly. And the good looking ones despised the others, saying: "We are better looking than they are." And because they became arrogant and conceited about their looks, the savory earth disappeared. At this they came together and lamented, crying, "Oh, that flavor! Oh, that flavor!" and so nowadays when people say, "Oh, that flavor!" when they get something nice, they are repeating an ancient saying without realizing it.'
p285
aS' \xe2\x80\x98And then, when the savory earth disappeared, a fungus cropped up, in the manner of a mushroom. It was of good color, smell, and taste. It was the color of fine ghee or butter, and it was very sweet, like pure wild honey. And those beings set to and ate the fungus. And this lasted for a very long time. And as they continued to feed on the fungus, so their bodies become coarser still, and the difference in their looks increased still more. And the good looking ones despised the others\xe2\x80\xa6and because they became arrogant and conceited about their looks, the sweet fungus disappeared. Next, creepers appeared, shooting up like bamboo\xe2\x80\xa6and they too were very sweet, like pure wild honey.'
p286
aS' \xe2\x80\x98And those beings set to and fed on those creepers. And as they did so, their bodies became even coarser, and the difference in their looks increased still more\xe2\x80\xa6and they became still more arrogant, and so the creepers disappeared too. At this they came together and lamented, crying: "Alas, our creepers gone! What have we lost!" and so now today when people, one being asked why they are upset, say: "Oh what have we lost!" they are repeating an ancient saying without realizing it.'
p287
aS' \xe2\x80\x98And then, after the creepers had disappeared, rice appeared in open spaces, free from powder and from husks, fragrant and clean grained. And what they had taken in the evening for supper had grown again and was ripe in the morning, and what they had taken in the morning for breakfast was ripe again by evening, with no sign of reaping. And these beings set to and fed on this rice, and this lasted for a very long time. And as they did so, their bodies became coarser still, and the difference in their looks became even greater. And the females developed female sex organs and the males developed male sex organs. And the women became excessively preoccupied with the men, and the men with the women. Owing to this excessive preoccupation with each other, passion was aroused, and their bodies burnt with lust. And later because of this burning, they indulged in sexual activity. But those who saw them indulging threw dust, ashes, or cow-dung at them, crying: "Die, you filthy beast! How can one being do such things to another!" Just as today, in some districts, when a daughter-in-law is led out, some people throw dirt at her, some ashes, and some cow dung, without realizing that they are repeating an ancient observance. What was considered bad form in those days is now considered good form.'
p288
aS' \xe2\x80\x98And those beings who in those days indulged in sex were not allowed into a village or town for one or two months. Accordingly those who indulged for an excessively long period in such immoral practices began to build themselves dwellings so as to indulge under cover.'
p289
aS' \xe2\x80\x98Now it occurred to one of those beings who was inclined to laziness, "Well now, why should I be bothered to gather rice in the evening for supper and in the morning for breakfast? Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I gather it all at once for both meals?" And he did so. Then another one came to him and said, "Come on, lets go rice-gathering." "No need, my friend, I\xe2\x80\x99ve gathered enough for both meals." Then the other, following his example, gathered enough rice for two days at a time, saying, "That should be about enough." Then another being came to that second one, "Come on, lets go rice gathering." "No need my friend, I\xe2\x80\x99ve gathered enough for two days." (The same for four, then eight days.) However, when those beings made a store of rice and lived on that, husk-powder and husk began to envelop the grain, and where it was reaped it did not grow again, and the cut place showed, and the rice grew in separate clusters.'
p290
aS' \xe2\x80\x98And then those beings came together lamenting, "Wicked ways have become rife among us: at first we were mind made, feeding on delight\xe2\x80\xa6(All the events are repeated down to the latest development, each fresh change being said to be due to \xe2\x80\x98wicked and unwholesome ways)\xe2\x80\xa6and the rice grows in separate clusters! So now let us divide up the rice into fields with boundaries." So they did so.'
p291
aS' \xe2\x80\x98Then, Vasettha, one greedy-natured being, while watching over his own plot, took another plot that was not given to him, and enjoyed the fruits of it. So they seized hold of him and said, "You\xe2\x80\x99ve done a wicked thing, taking another\xe2\x80\x99s plot like that! Don\xe2\x80\x99t ever do such a thing again!" "I won\xe2\x80\x99t," he said, but he did the same thing a second and a third time. Again, he was seized and rebuked, and some hit him with their fists, some with stones, and some with sticks. And in this way, Vasettha, taking what was not given, and censuring, and lying, and punishment took their origin.'
p292
aS'\xe2\x80\x98Then those beings came together and lamented the arising of these evil things among them: taking what was not given, censuring, lying, and punishment. And they thought: "Suppose we were to appoint a certain being who would show anger where anger was due, censure those who deserved it, and banish those who deserved banishment! And in return we would grant him a share of the rice." So they went to the one among them who was the handsomest, the best-looking, most pleasant and capable, and asked him to do this for them in return for a share of the rice, and he agreed.'
p293
aS' "The People\xe2\x80\x99s Choice" is the meaning of Maha-Sammata, [7] which is the first regular title to be introduced. "Lord of the Fields" is the meaning of Khattiya, the second such title. And "He Gladdens Others With Dhamma" is the meaning of Raja, the third title to be introduced. This, then, Vasettha, is the origin of the class of Khattiyas, in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them. They originated among the very same beings, like ourselves, no different and in accordance with Dhamma, not otherwise.'
p294
aS' Dhamma is the best thing for people In this life and the next as well. \xe2\x80\x98Then some beings thought, "Evil things have appeared among beings, such as taking what is not given, censuring, lying, punishment and banishment. We ought to put aside evil and unwholesome things." And they did so. "They Put Aside Evil and Unwholesome Things" is the meaning of Brahmin, which is the first regular title to be introduced for such people. They made leaf-huts in forest places and meditated in them. With the smoking fire gone out, with pestle cast aside, gathering alms for their evening and morning meals, they went away to a village, town, or royal city to seek their food, and then they returned to their leaf-huts to meditate. People saw this and noted how they meditated. "They Meditate" is the meaning of Jhayaka, which is the second regular title to be introduced.'
p295
aS' \xe2\x80\x98However, some of those beings, not being able to meditate in leaf huts, settled around towns and villages and compiled books. People saw them doing this and not meditating. \xe2\x80\x98Now "These Do Not Meditate" is the meaning of Ajjhayaka, which is the third regular title to be introduced. At that time it was regarded as a low designation, but now it is the higher. This, then, Vasettha, is the origin of the class of Brahmins in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them. Their origin was from among the very same beings, like themselves, not different, and in accordance with Dhamma, not otherwise.'
p296
aS' Dhamma is the best thing for people In this life and the next as well. \xe2\x80\x98And then, Vasettha, some of those beings, having paired off, adopted various trades, and this "various" is the meaning of Vessa, which came to be the regular title for such people. This then is the origin of the class of Vessas, in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them. Their origin was from among these very same beings like themselves, no different, and in accordance with Dhamma, not otherwise.'
p297
aS' \xe2\x80\x98And then, Vasettha, those beings that remained went in for hunting. "They Are Base Who Live By The Chase," and that is the meaning of Sudda, which came to be the regular title for such people. This, then, is the origin of the class of Suddas [8] in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them. Their origin was from among these very same beings like themselves, no different, and in accordance with Dhamma, not otherwise.'
p298
aS' \xe2\x80\x98And then, Vasettha, it came about that some Khattiya, dissatisfied with his own Dhamma, went forth from the household life into homelessness, thinking, "I will become an ascetic." And a Brahmin did likewise, a Vessa did likewise, and so did a Sudda. And from these four classes the class of ascetics came into existence. Their origin was from among these very same beings, like themselves, no different, and in accordance with Dhamma, not otherwise.'
p299
aS' Dhamma is the best thing for people In this life and the next as well.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98And, Vasettha, a Khattiya who has led a bad life in body, speech and thought, and who has wrong view will, in consequence of such wrong views and deeds, at the breaking up of the body after death, be reborn in a state of loss, an ill fate, the downfall, the hell-state. So too will a Brahmin, a Vessa or a Sudda. \xe2\x80\x98Likewise, a Khattiya who has led a good life in body, speech, and thought, and who has right view will, in consequence of such right view and deeds, at the breaking up of the body after death, be reborn in a good destiny, in a heaven-state. So too will a Brahmin, a Vessa or a Sudda.'

aS' I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi, at Jeta\'s Grove, Anathapindika\'s park. Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, he sat down to one side. As he was sitting there he asked the Blessed One: "How is it, Master Gotama, does Master Gotama hold the view: \'the cosmos is eternal: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless\'?" "...No." "Then does Master Gotama hold the view: \'the cosmos is not eternal: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless\'?" "...No." "Then does Master Gotama hold the view: \'the cosmos is finite: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless\'?" "...No." "Then does Master Gotama hold the view: \'the cosmos is infinite: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless\'?" "...No." "Then does Master Gotama hold the view: \'the soul and the body are the same: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless\'?" "...No." "Then does Master Gotama hold the view: \'the soul is one thing and the body another: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless\'?" "...No." "Then does Master Gotama hold the view: \'after death a Tath\xc3\xa1gata exists: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless\'?" "...No." "Then does Master Gotama hold the view: \'after death a Tath\xc3\xa1gata does not exist: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless\'?" "...No." "Then does Master Gotama hold the view: \'after death a Tath\xc3\xa1gata both exists and does not exist: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless\'?" "...No." "Then does Master Gotama hold the view: \'after death a Tath\xc3\xa1gata neither exists nor does not exist: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless\'?" "...No." '

aS' "How is it, Master Gotama, when Master Gotama is asked if he holds the view \'the cosmos is eternal...\' \'After death a Tath\xc3\xa1gata neither exists nor does not exist: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless,\' he says \'...no...\' in each case. Seeing what drawback, then, is Master Gotama thus entirely dissociated from each of these ten positions?" "Vaccha, the position that \'the cosmos is eternal\' is a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views. It is accompanied by suffering, distress, despair, and fever, and it does not lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation; to calm, direct knowledge, full Awakening, Unbinding.'

p306
aS' "Does Master Gotama have any position at all?" "A \'position,\' Vaccha, is something that a Tath\xc3\xa1gata has done away with. What a Tath\xc3\xa1gata sees is this: \'such is form, such its origin, such its disappearance; such is feeling, such its origin, such its disappearance; such is perception... such are mental fabrications... such is consciousness, such its origin, such its disappearance.\' Because of this, I say, a Tath\xc3\xa1gata -- with the ending, fading out, cessation, renunciation, and relinquishment of all construings, all excogitations, all I-making and mine-making and obsession with conceit -- is, through lack of clinging/sustenance, released." "But, Master Gotama, the monk whose mind is thus released: Where does he reappear?"'

aS' "\'Reappear,\' Vaccha, doesn\'t apply." "In that case, Master Gotama, he does not reappear." "\'Does not reappear,\' Vaccha, doesn\'t apply." "...Both does and does not reappear." "...Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t apply." "...Neither does nor does not reappear." "...Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t apply."'
p308
aS' "How is it, Master Gotama, when Master Gotama is asked if the monk reappears... does not reappear... both does and does not reappear... neither does nor does not reappear, he says, \'...doesn\'t apply\' in each case. At this point, Master Gotama, I am befuddled; at this point, confused. The modicum of clarity coming to me from your earlier conversation is now obscured." "Of course you\'re befuddled, Vaccha. Of course you\'re confused. Deep, Vaccha, is this phenomenon, hard to see, hard to realize, tranquil, refined, beyond the scope of conjecture, subtle, to-be-experienced by the wise. For those with other views, other practices, other satisfactions, other aims, other teachers, it is difficult to know. That being the case, I will now put some questions to you. Answer as you see fit. How do you construe this, Vaccha: If a fire were burning in front of you, would you know that, \'This fire is burning in front of me\'?" "...yes..." "And suppose someone were to ask you, Vaccha, \'This fire burning in front of you, dependent on what is it burning?\' Thus asked, how would you reply?" "...I would reply, \'This fire burning in front of me is burning dependent on grass and timber as its sustenance.\'" "If the fire burning in front of you were to go out, would you know that, \'this fire burning in front of me has gone out\'?" "...Yes." "And suppose someone were to ask you, \'this fire that has gone out in front of you, in which direction from here has it gone? East? West? North? Or south?\' Thus asked, how would you reply?" "That doesn\'t apply, Master Gotama. Any fire burning dependent on a sustenance of grass and timber, being unnourished -- from having consumed that sustenance and not being offered any other -- is classified simply as \'out\' (unbound)." "Even so, Vaccha, any physical form by which one describing the Tath\xc3\xa1gata would describe him: That the Tath\xc3\xa1gata has abandoned, its root destroyed, like an uprooted palm tree, deprived of the conditions of existence, not destined for future arising. Freed from the classification of form, Vaccha, the Tath\xc3\xa1gata is deep, boundless, hard to fathom, like the sea. \'Reappears\' doesn\'t apply. \'Does not reappear\' doesn\'t apply. \'Both does and does not reappear\' doesn\'t apply. \'Neither reappears nor does not reappear\' doesn\'t apply.'

aS' When this was said, the wanderer Vacchagotta said to the Blessed One: "Master Gotama, it is as if there were a great sala tree not far from a village or town: From inconstancy, its branches and leaves would wear away, its bark would wear away, its sapwood would wear away, so that on a later occasion -- divested of branches, leaves, bark, and sapwood -- it would stand as pure heartwood. In the same way, Master Gotama\'s words are divested of branches, leaves, bark, and sapwood and stand as pure heartwood. "Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or were to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama has -- through many lines of reasoning -- made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life."'

aS' On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta\'s Grove, Anathapindika\'s monastery. There he addressed the monks, "Monks!" "Yes, lord," the monks responded.'
p342
aS' The Blessed One said: "Monks, dwell consummate in virtue, consummate in terms of the Patimokkha. Dwell restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha, consummate in your behavior and sphere of activity. Train yourselves, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the slightest faults. [1] "If a monk would wish, \'May I be dear and pleasing to my fellows in the holy life, respected by and inspiring to them,\' then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to mental calm, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings. [2] "If a monk would wish, \'May I be someone who receives robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medical requisites for curing the sick,\' then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to mental calm, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings. [3] "If a monk would wish, \'Whatever I use or consume in terms of robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medical requisites for curing the sick, may that be of great fruit, of great benefit to those who provided them,\' then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to mental calm, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings. [4] "If a monk would wish, \'May it also be of great fruit, of great benefit, to whatever dead relatives they [the donors] recollect with brightened minds,\' then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to mental calm, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings. [5] "If a monk would wish, \'May I be content with whatever robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medical requisites for curing the sick are available,\' then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to mental calm, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings. [6] "If a monk would wish, \'May I be resistant to cold, heat, hunger, and thirst; to the touch of gadflies and mosquitoes, wind and sun and creeping things; to abusive, hurtful language; to bodily feelings that, when they arise, are painful, sharp, stabbing, fierce, distasteful, deadly,\' then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to mental calm, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings. [7] "If a monk would wish, \'May I overcome displeasure, and not be overcome by displeasure. May I dwell having conquered any displeasure that has arisen,\' then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to mental calm, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings. [8] "If a monk would wish, \'May I overcome fear and dread, and not be overcome by fear and dread. May I dwell having conquered any fear and dread that have arisen,\' then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to mental calm, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings. [9] "If a monk would wish, \'May I attain -- whenever I want, without strain, without difficulty -- the four jhanas that are heightened mental states, pleasant abiding in the here-and-now,\' then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to mental calm, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings. [10] "If a monk would wish, \'May I -- with the ending of mental fermentations -- remain in the fermentation-free release of awareness and release of discernment, having directly known and realized them for myself in the here-and-now,\' then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to mental calm, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings.'

aS' I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels\' Sanctuary. Then the Brahmin Akkosaka ("Insulter") Bharadvaja heard that a Brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan had gone forth from the home life into homelessness in the presence of the Blessed One. Angered and displeased, he went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, insulted and cursed him with rude, harsh words.'
p388
aS' When this was said, the Blessed One said to him: "What do you think, Brahmin: Do friends and colleagues, relatives and kinsmen come to you as guests?"  "Yes, Master Gautama, sometimes friends and colleagues, relatives and kinsmen come to me as guests."  "And what do you think: Do you serve them with staple and non-staple foods and delicacies?"  "Yes, sometimes I serve them with staple and non-staple foods and delicacies."  "And if they don\'t accept them, to whom do those foods belong?"  "If they don\'t accept them, Master Gautama, those foods are all mine." '
p389
aS' "In the same way, Brahmin, that with which you have insulted me, who is not insulting; that with which you have taunted me, who is not taunting; that with which you have berated me, who is not berating: that I don\'t accept from you. It\'s all yours, Brahmin. It\'s all yours.  "Whoever returns insult to one who is insulting, returns taunts to one who is taunting, returns a berating to one who is berating, is said to be eating together, sharing company, with that person. But I am neither eating together nor sharing your company, Brahmin. It\'s all yours. It\'s all yours."  "The king together with his court know this of Master Gautama -- \'Gautama the contemplative is an arhat\' -- and yet still Master Gautama gets angry."'

p391
aS' When this was said, the Brahmin Akkosaka Bharadvaja said to the Blessed One, "Magnificent, Master Gautama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what had been overturned, were to reveal what was hidden, were to show the way to one who was lost, or were to hold up a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way Master Gautama has -- through many lines of reasoning -- made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the community of monks. Let me obtain the going forth in Master Gautama\xe2\x80\x99s presence, let me obtain admission." '
p392
aS' Then the Brahmin Akkosaka Bharadvaja received the going forth and the admission in the Blessed One\'s presence. And not long after his admission -- dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, and resolute -- he in no long time reached and remained in the supreme goal of the holy life, for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing and realizing it for himself in the here and now. He knew: "Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world." And so Ven. Bharadvaja became another one of the Arhats. '
p393
aS' Thus I heard: At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anathapindika in Jeta\xe2\x80\x99s grove in Savatthi. At that time to a Bhikkhu named Arittha, a vulture trainer in his previous birth, this evil view had arisen. As I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments. Then many Bhikkhus heard that this evil view had arisen to the Bhikkhu Arittha, a vulture trainer in his previous birth As I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments.'
p394
aS' Then they approached the Bhikkhu Arittha and asked him: Friend Arittha is it true that such an evil view has arisen to you: As I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments. Yes, friends, as I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, to one who pursues those impedimental things declared, as impediments are not suitable impediments. Then those Bhikkhus thinking to dissuade the Bhikkhu Arittha from that evil view, cross questioned him, asked for reasons and discussed with him. Friend, Arittha do not say that, do not accuse the Blessed One. The Blessed One did not say that. The Blessed One has shown in various ways how these impedimental things are impediments to one who pursues them. The Blessed One has said that sensuality brings little satisfaction much unpleasantness and much trouble, there are many dangers there. The Blessed One has said that sensuality is comparable to a skeleton, a tendon of flesh, a burning grass torch, a pit full of burning charcoal, a dream, something borrowed, like a tree full of fruits, a slaughter house, the blade of a weapon, the head of a serpent. The Blessed One has said that sensuality brings much unpleasantness, much trouble and many dangers. Even when so much was told the Bhikkhu Arittha held on tenaciously to his view and would not give it up; as I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments'
p395
aS' When the Bhikkhus could not dissuade the Bhikkhu Arittha from that evil view, they approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said thus: Venerable sir, to a Bhikkhu named Arittha, a vulture trainer in his previous birth, this evil view had arisen. As I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments. Then many of us heard that this evil view had arisen to the Bhikkhu Arittha, a vulture trainer in his previous birth As I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments.'
p396
aS' Then we approached the Bhikkhu Arittha and asked him : Friend Arittha is it true that such an evil view has arisen to you: As I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments. He said, yes, friends, as I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments. Then we Bhikkhus thinking to dissuade the Bhikkhu Arittha from that evil view, cross questioned him, asked for reasons and discussed with him.

p397
aS' Then the Blessed One addressed a certain Bhikkhu and said, Come Bhikkhu, in my words call the Bhikkhu Arittha, tell, the Teacher wants him. That Bhikkhu consenting approached the Bhikkhu Arittha and told him, Friend, the Teacher wants you.. The Bhikkhu Arittha saying yes, friend, approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side. Then the Blessed One said, Arittha, is it true, that such a view has arisen to you, As I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments, are not suitable impediments. Then he said, yes, venerable sir, as I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, to one who pursues those impedimental things, declared as impediments, are not suitable impediments.- Foolish man, to whom do you know me teaching this. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I in many ways told that the impedimental things are impediments, indeed to one who pursues them they are impediments. I have told that sensuality brings little satisfaction, much un-pleasantness and trouble, the dangers here are many. - I have told that sensuality is comparable to a skeleton, a tendon of flesh, a burning grass torch, a pit of burning charcoal, a dream, something borrowed, a tree full of fruits, the blade of a weapon, the head of a serpent, I have told it has much unpleasantness, much trouble and the dangers there are many. Yet you foolish man, on account of your wrong view you accuse me and destroy yourself and accumulate much demerit, which will be for your unpleasantness for a long time. Then the Blessed One addressed :Bhikkhus, what do you think, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we chastise this Bhikkhu Arittha, a vulture trainer in his earlier birth from this dispensation When this was said the Bhikkhu Arittha a vulture trainer in his earlier birth became silent, and unable to reply back, with a drooping form sat with eyes turned down. Then the Blessed One knowing that the Bhikkhu Arittha a vulture trainer in his earlier birth has become silent, unable to reply back, with a drooping form sitting with eyes turned down told him, foolish man, you will be pointed out on account of this evil view, now I will question the Bhikkhus on this'

aS' Then the Blessed One addressed the Bhikkhus; Bhikkhus, do you too know of this Teaching, the wrong view of the Bhikkhu Arittha, a vulture trainer in his earlier birth on account of which he brings blame on us and also destroys himself and accumulates much unpleasantness. -No venerable sir, The impedimental things are told by the Blessed One and indeed to one who pursues them, they are impediments. The Blessed One has said that there is little satisfaction in sensuality, much unpleasantness and much trouble, the dangers there are many. The Blessed One has said that sensuality is comparable to a skeleton, a tendon of flesh, a burning grass torch, a pit of burning charcoal, a dream, something borrowed, a tree full of fruits, the blade of a weapon, and the head of a serpent. The Blessed On has said it has much unpleasantness, much trouble and the dangers there are many.. Good! Bhikkhus, Good, that you know the Teaching taught by me. In various ways I have shown the impedimental things and indeed it is impedimental to pursues them. I have told that sensuality brings little satisfaction, much unpleasantness and the dangers there are many. I have told it is comparable to skeleton--to the head of a serpent brings little satisfaction, much unpleasantness and the dangers there are many. Yet the Bhikkhu Arittha holding to this wrong view blames us and destroys himself and accumulates much demerit, and it will be for his unpleasantness for a long time.'

aS' Bhikkhus, someone could indulge in sensuality, without sensual perceptions, without sensual thoughts is not possible Bhikkhus, a certain foolish man learns the prose sections, prose and verse sections, the answers and explanation expositions, stanzas, solemn utterances, thus said sections, birth stories, wonderful things, a series of questions and answers. He thoroughly learns the Teaching but does not examine the meanings with wisdom. So he cannot take pleasure in the Teaching. He learns the Teaching for the purpose of finding fault. He takes a wrong grasp of the Teaching and that conduces for his unpleasantness for a long time. The reason is the wrong grasp of the Teaching. Like a man wandering in search of a serpent would come to a huge serpent, he would take hold of the serpent by the hood or the tail and it would turn round and sting the hand or foot or any other limb. On account of this wrong grasp of the serpent he would meet death or deadly unpleasantness. In the same manner a certain foolish man learns the prose sections, prose and verse sections, the answers and explanation expositions, stanzas, solemn utterances, thus said sections, birth stories, wonderful things, a series of questions and answers.

aS' Bhikkhus, this Teaching is for giving up not for taking hold of, listen to it carefully. Like a man come to the highway would see a large stretch of water, the hither shore dangerous and fearful, the thither shore peaceful and without fear. There is no ship or overhead bridge to cross over from the hither shore to the thither. What if I build a raft collecting grass, sticks, branches and creepers. So he built a raft collecting grass sticks branches and creepers, and making effort with hands and feet reached the other shore safely. Then to the one who has crossed over this thought occurred This raft was of great service to me, I safely crossed over to the other shore boarding it and putting forth effort with my hands and feet. What if I balance it on my head or haul it on my back and go where I like. Bhikkhus, is he doing the right thing if he does so with the raft.- Doing what will he be doing the right thing with the raft.. Bhikkhus, to the man who has crossed over it occurs thus: This raft was of great service to me, I safely crossed over to the other shore boarding it and putting forth effort with my hands and feet. What if I pulled it up to dry ground , or sink it in the water and go where I like. A man doing that would be doing the right thing. Just so, Bhikkhus, my Teaching is comparable to a raft for the purpose of crossing over and not for getting hold of. You should give up even the Teaching that should be known, and what about that which should not be known...'

aS' Bhikkhus, these six are the views. What six. Bhikkhus, the ordinary man who has not seen the noble ones and Great Beings, not clever in their Teaching, and not trained in their Teaching Sees matter: that is me, I am that, that is my self. Sees feelings,; that is me, I am that, that is my self. Sees determinations: that is me, I am that, that is my self. Whatever seen, heard, tasted, smelt and bodily felt, cognized, attained, sought after, and reflected in the mind: that is me, I am that, that is my self The world, the self, I will be in the future, permanent, not changing, an eternal thing.; that is me, I am that, that is my self. Bhikkhus, the learned noble disciple, who has seen noble ones and Great Beings, clever in their Teaching, and trained in their Teaching sees matter: that is not me, am not that, that is not my self.

Sees determinations: that is not me am not that, that is not my self, Whatever seen, heard, tasted, smelt, bodily felt, cognized, attained, sought after, and reflected in the mind: that is not me, am not that, that is not my self. The world, the self, I will be in the future, permanent, not changing, an eternal thing, that is not me, am not that, that is not my self.. Seeing it is not present, is not excited. . When this was said, a certain Bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: Venerable sir, is there excitement for external non presence. The Blessed One said, there is Bhikkhu. Here, Bhikkhu, it occurs to someone thus: There was to me, now it is not to me, I had, now I do not gain, he grieves, laments and beats the breast and comes to bewilderment of mind. Thus there is excitement for external non-presence. - Venerable sir, is there non-excitement for external non-presence. The Blessed One said, there is Bhikkhu. Here, Bhikkhu, it does not occur to someone: There was to me, now it is not to me, I had, now I do not gain, he does not grieve or lament, does not beat the breast and come to bewilderment of mind. Thus there is no excitement for external non-presence. -Venerable sir, is there excitement for internal non-presence: The Blessed One said, there is Bhikkhu. Here, Bhikkhu, to a certain one there is this view. The world, the self, I will be in the future, permanent, not changing, an eternal thing. Then he hears this Teaching from the Thus Gone One or from a disciple of the Thus Gone One for the complete abolishment of views, determinant resolutions, prepossessions, latent tendencies for settlements, for the appeasement of all determinations, for the giving up of all endearments, for the destruction of craving, for non attachment, cessation and extinction. Then it occurs to him, indeed it will be my annihilation, my destruction, I will not be. He grieves, laments, beats the breast and comes to bewilderment of mind. Thus, there is excitement for internal non-presence. Venerable sir, is there non-excitement for internal non-presence.'

aS' Bhikkhus, do you see anything permanent, not changing, eternal, to seize. No, venerable sir. Good! I too do not see anything to seize that which is permanent, not changing, and stands eternity. Bhikkhus, is there the holding of a self view which does not give birth to grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress. No, venerable sir. Good! I too do not see a self view which does not give birth to grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress. Bhikkhus is there a settled view which does not give birth to grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress. No, venerable sir. Good!

aS' Bhikkhus, when there are belongings of a self, is there a satisfaction, these are mine. Yes, venerable sir.. A self or the belongings of a self, in reality and truth cannot be gained. Bhikkhus, this settled view, about the world, and the self, I will be in the future, permanent, not changing, standing eternity, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a completely foolish notion- Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, venerable sir, it is a completely foolish notion- What do you think:-- Is matter permanent or impermanent.-- Impermanent, venerable sir.-- That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant.-- -Unpleasant venerable sir. --That which is impermanent, unpleasant, a changing thing is it good to be considered that is me, that I am that is my self. -- No, venerable sir.-- Is feeling permanent or impermanent.-- Impermanent, venerable sir.-- That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant.-- -Unpleasant venerable sir. --That which is impermanent, unpleasant, a changing thing is it good to be considered that is me, that I am, that is my self.-- No, venerable sir --Are perceptions permanent or impermanent.-- Impermanent, venerable sir.-- That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant.-- -Unpleasant venerable sir. --That which is impermanent, unpleasant, a changing thing is it good to be considered that is me, that I am, that is my self.-- No, venerable sir.- -Are determinations permanent or impermanent.-- Impermanent, venerable sir.-- That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant.-- -Unpleasant venerable sir. --That which is impermanent, unpleasant, a changing thing is it good to be considered that is me, that I am, that is my self.-- No, venerable sir. --Is consciousness permanent or impermanent.-- Impermanent, venerable sir.-- That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant.-- -Unpleasant venerable sir. --That which is impermanent, unpleasant, a changing thing is it good to be considered that is me, that I am, that is my self.-- No, venerable sir. -- Therefore Bhikkhus, whatever matter, in the past, future or present, internal or external, exalted or un-exalted, far or near, all matter is not me, that am not, that is not my self- should be realized as it really is, with right wisdom. Whatever feelings-- whatever perceptions, --whatever determinations--whatever consciousness, in the past, future or present, internal or external, exalted or un-exalted, far or near, all consciousness is not me, that am not, that is not my self, should be realized as it really is, with right wisdom.'

aS' The learned noble disciple seeing thus detaches from matter, detaches from feelings, detaches from perceptions, detaches from determinations, detaches from consciousness. Detached is released. Released knowledge arises am released. Birth destroyed, the holy life lived to the end, what should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish for, he knows. To this is called removing the obstacle, filling the trenches, pulling out desires, seeing results, the noble one puts down the flag and is unyoked Bhikkhus, how does the Bhikkhu remove the obstacle; Here the Bhikkhus ignorance is dispelled, pulled out from the roots, and made a palm stump of it, so that it may not rise again. Thus the obstacle is removed. How does the Bhikkhu fill up the trenches; Here the Bhikkhu dispels the recurring births, making a palm stump of it so that it may not rise again. Thus the Bhikkhu fills up the trenches. How does the Bhikkhu pull out desires. Here the Bhikkhu dispels greed, together with the roots, makes it a palm stump, so that it may not rise again. Thus the Bhikkhu pulls out desires. How does the Bhikkhu see results. Here the Bhikkhu dispels the bonds to the sensual world, cuts them up completely, so that they may not rise again. Thus the Bhikkhu sees results. How does the noble one put down the flag and unyoke. Here the Bhikkhu dispels the conceit \xe2\x80\x98I be\xe2\x80\x99 pulling it out from the roots makes a palm stump of it, so that it may not rise again.

p407
aS' Bhikkhus, if that released mind of the Bhikkhu was to be searched by Inda, Brahma, Pajapati and their retinue, it would not be found; thus unsupported is the consciousness of the Thus Gone One. What is the reason: I say that the Thus Gone One cannot be found even here and now. To me who says thus and preaches thus, certain recluses and Brahmins ingenuinely, untruthfully blame, the recluse Gotama the discipliner, purposefully shows the annihilation, destruction, and non evidence of beings. Bhikkhus, whatever I am not, that I do not proclaim, as a result these good recluses and Brahmins ingenuinely, untruthfully blame, the recluse Gotama the discipliner purposefully shows the annihilation, destruction and non-evidence of beings. Earlier and now also I declare -Unpleasant and its cessation. Others abuse, blame and annoy the Thus Gone One, for that the Thus Gone One has no ill feeling , aversion or discontent .Some others honor, revere and worship the Thus Gone One, for that the Thus Gone One has no blissful pleasurable joy. When others honor, revere and worship the Thus Gone One, it occurs to him, it is on account of what I have thoroughly understood that they do it. Bhikkhus, when others abuse, blame and annoy you, ill feeling, aversion and discontent should not be to you. Again Bhikkhus, when others honor, revere and worship you, a blissful pleasurable joy should not be to you. It should occur to you, it is on account of what I have thoroughly understood, that they do it..'
p408
aS' Therefore Bhikkhus, if people carry away, burn or do what they like to grass-sticks-branches-creepers in this same Jeta\xe2\x80\x99s grove, would it occur to you; People are carrying away, burning and doing what they like to us-- No, venerable sir.- What is the reason: Venerable sir, they are not our selves or the belongings of ourselves. -- Bhikkhus, in the same manner, whatever is not yours, dispel it., for your good welfare and pleasantness for a long time. Bhikkhus, what is not yours. Matter is not yours, dispel it for your good, welfare and pleasantness for a long time. Feeling is not yours, dispel it for your good, welfare and pleasantness for a long time. Perception is not yours, dispel it for your good, welfare and pleasantness for a long time. Determinations are not yours, dispel it for your good, welfare and pleasantness for a long time. Consciousness is not yours, dispel it for your good welfare and pleasantness for a long time.'

My Teaching is so well proclaimed, made manifest, open and threadbare'
p410
aS' Those Bhikkhus who have dispelled the five lower fetters, they all arise spontaneously, and extinguish there itself, do not proceed from that world. My Teaching is so well proclaimed, made manifest, open and threadbare. Those Bhikkhus, who have dispelled the three fetters and diminishing greed, hate and delusion, they all become once returners, coming only once more to this world, to make an end of un-pleasantness. My Teaching is so well proclaimed, made manifest, open and threadbare. Those Bhikkhus who have dispelled the three fetters, all of them enter the stream of the Teaching, do not fall from there intending only extinction. My Teaching is so well proclaimed, made manifest, open and threadbare. Those who have some faith in me, some love for me they all are intent on heaven.

He tolerates cold, heat, hunger, and thirst; the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; ill-spoken, unwelcome words and bodily feelings that, when they arise, are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, disagreeable, displeasing, and menacing to life.

Reflecting appropriately, he avoids sitting in the sorts of unsuitable seats, wandering to the sorts of unsuitable habitats, and associating with the sorts of bad friends that would make his knowledgeable friends in the holy life suspect him of evil conduct.

aS' I heard thus: At one time the Blessed One was living in the Squirrels\xe2\x80\x99 Sanctuary in the bamboo grove in Rajagaha. At that time venerable Rahula lived in Ambalatthika. Then the Blessed One getting up from his seclusion in the evening approached venerable Rahula in Ambalatthika.

aS" I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Rajagaha, at the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Feeding Ground. At that time Ven. Rahula [1] was staying at the Mango Stone. Then the Blessed One, arising from his seclusion in the late afternoon, went to where Ven. Rahula was staying at the Mango Stone. Ven. Rahula saw him coming from afar and, on seeing him, set out a seat and water for washing the feet. The Blessed One sat down on the seat set out and, having sat down, washed his feet. Ven. Rahula, bowing down to the Blessed One, sat down to one side."
p459
aS' Then the Blessed One, having left a little bit of the remaining water in the water dipper, said to Ven. Rahula, "Rahula, do you see this little bit of remaining water left in the water dipper?" "Yes sir." "That\'s how little of a contemplative [2] there is in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie." Having tossed away the little bit of remaining water, the Blessed One said to Ven. Rahula, "Rahula, do you see how this little bit of remaining water is tossed away?" "Yes, sir." "Whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is tossed away just like that. Having turned the water dipper upside down, the Blessed One said to Ven.

The elephant trainer notices that and thinks, \'This royal elephant has not given up its life to the king.\' But when the royal elephant... having gone into battle, uses its forefeet and hind feet, its forequarters and hindquarters, its head and ears and tusks and tail and his trunk, the trainer notices that and thinks, \'This royal elephant has given up its life to the king.

aS' Thus have I heard. Once the lord was touring Kosala with a large number of monks, some five hundred, and he came to a Kosalan Brahmin village called Icchanankala. And he stayed in the dense jungle of Icchanankala. At that time the Brahmin Pokkharasati was living at Ukkhattha, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which had been given to him by king Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal gift with royal powers.'
p474
aS' And Pokkharasati heard say, "The ascetic Gotama, son of the Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan, is staying in the dense jungle of Icchanankala. And concerning that Blessed Lord a good report has been spread about, \xe2\x80\x98This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully enlightened Buddha, perfected in knowledge and conduct, a well-farer, knower of the worlds, unequalled trainer of men to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, a Blessed Lord.\xe2\x80\x99 He proclaims this world with its gods, Maras, Brahmas, the world of ascetics and Brahmins with its princes and people, having come to know it by his own knowledge. He teaches a Dhamma that is ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and he displays the fully perfected, thoroughly purified holy life. And indeed it is good to see such Arahants."'
p475
aS' Now, at that time Pokkharasati had a pupil, the youth Ambattha, who was a student of the Vedas, who knew the mantras, perfected in the Three Vedas, a skilled expounder of the rules and rituals, the lore of sounds and meanings and, fifthly, oral tradition, complete in philosophy and the marks of a great man, admitted and accepted by his master in the Three Vedas with the words, "What I know, you know; what you know, I know."\xe2\x80\xa8And Pokkharasati said to Ambattha, "Ambattha, my son, the ascetic Gotama, son of the Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan, is staying in the dense jungle of Icchanankala. And concerning that Blessed Lord a good report has been spread about, , "This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully enlightened Buddha, perfected in knowledge and conduct, a well-farer, knower of the worlds, unequalled trainer of men to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, a Blessed Lord.\xe2\x80\x99 Now you go to see the ascetic Gotama and find out whether this report is correct or not, and whether the Reverend Gotama is as they say or not. In that way we shall put the Reverend Gotama to the test."'
p476
aS' "Sir, how shall I find out whether the report is true, or whether the Reverend Gotama is as they say or not?" "According to the tradition of our Mantras, Ambattha, the great man who is possessed of the thirty two marks of a great man has only two courses open to him. If he lives the household life he will become a ruler, a wheel-turning righteous monarch of the law, conqueror of the four quarters, who has established the security of his realm and is possessed of the seven treasures. These are, The Wheel Treasure, the Elephant Treasure, the Horse Treasure, the Jewel Treasure, the Woman Treasure, the Householder Treasure, and, as a seventh, the Counselor Treasure. He has more than a thousand sons who are heroes, of heroic stature, conquerors of the hostile army. He dwells having conquered the sea-girt land without a stick or sword, by the law. But if he goes forth from the household life into homelessness, then he will become an Arahant, a fully enlightened Buddha, one who draws back the view from the world. And, Ambattha, I am the passer-on of the Mantras, and you are the receiver."'
p477
aS' "Very good, sir" said Ambattha at Pokkharasati\xe2\x80\x99s words, and he got up, passed by Pokkharasati with his right side, got into his chariot drawn by a mare and, accompanied by a number of young me, headed for the dense jungle of Icchanankala. He drove as far as the carriage would go, then alighted and continued on foot.'
p478
aS' At that time a number of monks were walking up and down in the open air. Ambattha approached them and said, "Where is the Reverend Gotama to be found just now? We have come to see the Reverend Gotama."'
p479
aS' The monks considered Ambattha and thought, "This is Ambattha, a youth of good family and a pupil of the distinguished Brahmin Pokkharasati. The Lord would not mind having a conversation with such a young man." And they said to Ambattha,'
p480
aS' "That is his dwelling, with the door closed. Go quietly up to it, go on to the veranda without haste, cough, and knock on the bolt. The Lord will open the door to you."'
p481
aS' Ambattha went up to the dwelling and onto the veranda, coughed, and knocked. The Lord opened the door, and Ambattha went it. The young men entered, exchanged courtesies with the Lord, and sat down to one side. But Ambattha walked up and down while the Lord sat there, uttered some vague words of politeness, and then stood so speaking before the seated lord. [That was considered very rude behavior]'
p482
aS' And the Lord said to Ambattha, "Well now, Ambattha, would you behave like this if you were talking to venerable and learned Brahmins, teachers of teachers, as you do with me, walking and standing while I am sitting, and uttering vague words of politeness?"'
p483
aS' "No, Reverend Gotama. A Brahmin should walk with a walking Brahmin, stand with a standing Brahmin, sit with a sitting Brahmin, sit with a sitting Brahmin, and lie down with a Brahmin who is lying down. But as for those shaven little ascetics, menials, black scourings from Brahmas foot, with them it is fitting to speak just as I do with the Reverend Gotama."'
p484
aS' "But, Ambattha, you came here seeking something. Whatever it was you came for, you should listen attentively to hear about it. Ambattha, you have not perfected your training. Your conceit of being trained is due to nothing but inexperience."'
p485
aS' But Ambattha was angry and displeased at being called untrained, and he turned on the Lord with curses and insults. Thinking, "The ascetic Gotama bears me ill-will" he said, "Reverend Gotama, the Sakyans are fierce, rough spoken, touchy and violent. Being of menial origin, being menials, they do not honor, respect, esteem, revere or pay homage to Brahmins. With regard to this it is not proper that they [behave in such a manner and] do not pay homage to Brahmins. [He is complaining that they do not honor the rigid "caste system" of India. \xe2\x80\x93BIONA webmaster] This was the first time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of being menials.'
p486
aS' "But, Ambattha, what have the Sakyans done to you?" "Reverend Gotama, once I went to Kapilavatthu on some business for my teacher, the Brahmin Pokkharasati, and I cam to the Sakyans meeting hall. And at that time a lot of Sakyans were sitting on high seats in their meeting hall, poking each other with their fingers, laughing and playing about together, and it seemed to me that they were just making fun of me, and no offered me a seat. With regard to this, it is not proper that they do not pay homage to the Brahmins." This was the second time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of being menials.'
p487
aS' "But, Ambattha, even the quail, that little bird, can talk as she likes in her own nest. Kapilavatthu is the Sakyans home, Ambattha. They do not deserve censure for such a trifle." "Reverend Gotama, there are four castes: The Khattiyas, the Brahmins, the merchants and the artisans. And of these four castes, three \xe2\x80\x93 the Khattiyas, the merchants, and the artisans \xe2\x80\x93 are entirely subservient to the Brahmins." This was the third time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of being menials.'
p488
aS' Then the Lord thought, "This young man goes too far is abusing the Sakyans. Suppose I were to ask after his clan name?" So he said, "Ambattha, what is your clan?" "I am a Kanhayan, Reverend Gotama."'
p489
aS' "Ambattha, in former days, according to those who remember the ancestral lineage, the Sakyans were the masters, and you are descended from a slave girl of the Sakyans. For the Sakyans regard to king Okkaka, to whom his queen was dear and beloved, wishing to transfer the kingdom to her son, banished his elder brothers from the kingdom \xe2\x80\x93 Okkamukha, Karandu, Hatthiniya, and Sinipura. And these, being banished, made their home on the flank of the Himalayas beside a lotus pond where there was a growth of teak-trees. And for fear of contaminating their stock they cohabitated with their own sisters. Then King Okkaha asked his ministers and counselors, "Where are the princes living now?" And they told him. At this, King Okkaha exclaimed, "They are strong as Saka trees, these princes, they are real Sakyans!" And this how the Sakyans go their well-known name. And the king was the ancestor of the Sakyans.'
p490
aS' "Now King Okkaha has a slave girl called Disa, who gave birth to a Kanha [dirty, black] child. The black thing, when it was born, exclaimed, "Wash me, mother! Bath me, mother! Deliver me from this dirt and I will bring you profit!" Because, Ambattha, just as people today use the term hobgoblin as a term of abuse, so in those days did they say Kanha. And they said, "As soon as he was born, he spoke! He is born a Kanha, a hobgoblin!" That is how, in former days according to those who remember the ancestral lineage, the Sakyans were the masters, and you are descended from a slave girl of the Sakyans."'
p491
aS' On hearing this, the young men said, "Reverend Gotama, do not humiliate Ambattha too much with talk of his being descended from a slave girl: Ambattha is well born, of a good family, he is very learned, he is well-spoken, a scholar, well able to hold his own in this discussion with the Reverend Gotama!"'
p492
aS' Then the Lord said to the young men, "If you consider that Ambattha is ill-born, not of good family, unlearned, ill-spoke, unable to hold his own in this discussion with the ascetic Gotama, then let Ambattha be silent, and you conduct this discussion with me. But if you think he is well born, of a good family, he is very learned, he is well-spoken, a scholar, able to hold his own, then you be quiet and let him discuss with me."'
p493
aS' "Ambattha is well born, Reverend Gotama, of a good family, he is very learned, he is well-spoken, a scholar, able to hold his own. We shall be silent, he shall continue." Then the Lord said to Ambattha, "Ambattha, I have a fundamental question for you, which you will not like to answer. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t answer, or if you evade the issue, if you keep silent or go away, your head will split into seven pieces. What do you think, Ambattha? Have you heard from old and venerable Brahmins, teachers of teachers, where the Kanhayans came from, or who was their ancestor?"'
p494
aS' At this, Ambattha remained silent, and the lord said, "Answer me now, Ambattha, this is not the time for silence. Whoever, Ambattha, does not answer a fundamental question put to him by a Tath\xc3\xa1gata by the third asking has his head split into seven pieces." [This is a pre-Buddhist mythos that, as Rhys Davids observes, never comes to anything.]'
p495
aS' And at that moment Vajrapani the Yaksha, [This god is also called "Indra." He is ready to make good on the mytho mentioned above. The old gods are supporting the new religion. Vajrapani also appears as a Bodhisattva in later Mahayana Sutras.] holding up a huge iron club, flaming, ablaze and glowing, up in the sky just above Ambattha was thinking, "If this young man does not answer a proper question put to him by the Blessed Lord by the third time of asking, I\xe2\x80\x99ll split his head into seven pieces!" The Lord saw Vajrapani, and so did Ambattha. And at the sight, Ambattha was terrified and unnerved, his hairs stood on end, and he sought protection, shelter, and safety from the Lord. Crouching down close to the Lord, he said, "What did the Reverend Gotama say? May the Reverend Gotama repeat what he said!"'
p496
aS' "What do you think, Ambattha? Have you heard from old and venerable Brahmins, teachers of teachers, where the Kanhayans came from, or who was their ancestor?" "Yes, I have heard it just as the Reverend Gotama said, that is where the Kanhayans came from, he was their ancestor"'
p497
aS' Hearing this, the young men made a loud noise and clamor, "So Ambattha is ill-born, not of a good family, born of a slave girl of the Sakyans, and the Sakyans are Ambattha\xe2\x80\x99s masters! We disparages the Ascetic Gotama, thinking he was not speaking the truth!"'
p498
aS' Then the Lord thought, "It is too much, the way these young men humiliate Ambattha for being the ancestor of a slave girl. I must get him out of this." So he said to the young men, "Don\xe2\x80\x99t disparage Ambattha too much for being the ancestor of a slave girl! That Kahna was a mighty sage [Known more commonly today as Krishna --BIONA Webmaster.] He went to the south country, learnt the mantras of the Brahmins there, and then went to King Okkaka and asked for his daughter Maddarupi. And Okkaka, furiously angry, exclaimed, "So this fellow, the son of a slave girl, wants my daughter!" And put an arrow to his bow. But he unable either to shoot to arrow or to withdraw it. Then the ministers and the counselors came together to the Sage Kanha and said, "Spare the King, Reverend Sir, spare the king!"'
p499
aS' "The king will be safe, but if he looses the arrow downwards, the earth will quake as far as his kingdom extends." "Reverend Sir, Spare the king, spare the land!" "The king and the land will be safe, but if he looses the arrow upwards, as for as his realm extends the god will not let it rain for seven years. [According to Rhys Davids this is a Bluff, as the spell could only stop the discharge of an arrow.]'
p500
aS' "Reverend Sir, spare the king, Spare the land, and may the god let it rain!" "The king and the land will be safe, and the god will let it rain, but if the king points the arrow at the crown prince, the prince will be completely safe."'
p501
aS' "Then the Ministers exclaimed, "Let King Okkaka point the arrow at the crown prince, the prince will be perfectly safe!" The king did so and the prince was unharmed. Then king Okkaka, terrified and fearful of divine punishment gave away his daughter to Maddarupi. So, young men, do not disparage Ambattha too much for being the ancestor of a slave girl. That Kahna was a mighty sage."'
p502
aS' Then the lord said, "Ambattha, what do you think? Suppose a Khattiya youth were to wed a Brahmin maiden, and there was a son of the union. Would that son of a Khattiya youth and a Brahmin maiden receive a seat and water from the Brahmins?" "He would, Reverend Gotama."\xe2\x80\xa8"Would they allow him to eat at funeral-rites, at rice-offerings, at sacrifices, or as a guest?" "They would, Reverend Gotama." "Would they teach him mantras or not?" "They would, Reverend Gotama." "Would they keep their women covered or uncovered?" "Uncovered, Reverend Gotama." "But would the Khattiyas sprinkle him with the Khattiya consencration?" "No, Reverend Gotama." "Why not?" "Because, Reverend Gotama, he is not well born on his mothers side." "What do you think, Ambattha? Suppose a Brahmin youth were to wed a Khattiya maiden, and there was a son of the union. Would that son of a Khattiya youth and a Brahmin maiden receive a seat and water from the Brahmins?" "He would, Reverend Gotama." "He would, Reverend Gotama." "Would they allow him to eat at funeral-rites, at rice-offerings, at sacrifices, or as a guest?" "They would, Reverend Gotama." "Would they teach him mantras or not?" "They would, Reverend Gotama." "Would they keep their women covered or uncovered?" "Uncovered, Reverend Gotama." "But would the Khattiyas sprinkle him with the Khattiya consecration?" "No, Reverend Gotama." "Why not?" "Because, Reverend Gotama, he is not well born on his fathers side." "So, Ambattha, the Khattiyas, through a man taking a woman or a woman taking a man, are senior to the Brahmins. What do you think, Ambattha? Take the case of a Brahmin who, for some reason, has had his head shaved by the Brahmins, has been punished with a bag of ashes and banished from the country or the city.\xc2\xa0 Would he receive a seat and water from the Brahmins?"\xc2\xa0 "No, Reverend Gotama." "Would they allow him to eat at funeral-rites, at rice-offerings, at sacrifices, or as a guest?"\xc2\xa0 "No, Reverend Gotama." "Would they teach him mantras, or not?"\xc2\xa0 "They would not, Reverend Gotama." "Would they keep their women covered or uncovered?"\xc2\xa0 "Covered, Reverend Gotama." "What do you think, Ambattha?\xc2\xa0 Take the case of a Khattiya who, for some reason, had his head shaved by the Khattiyas, has been punished with a bag of ashes and banished from the country or the city.\xc2\xa0 Would he receive a seat and water from the Brahmins?"\xc2\xa0 "He would, Reverend Gotama." "Would they keep their women covered or uncovered?"\xc2\xa0 "Uncovered, Reverend Gotama." "But that Khattiya has so far reached the extreme of humiliation that he has \xe2\x80\xa6 been banished from the country or the city.\xc2\xa0 So even if a Khattiya has suffered extreme humiliation, he is superior and the Brahmins inferior. "Ambittha, this verse was pronounced by Brahma Sanankumara: "The Khattiya\xe2\x80\x99s best among those who value clan;\xe2\x80\xa8\xc2\xa0He with knowledge and conduct is best of Gods and men." "This verse was rightly sung, not wrongly, rightly spoken, not wrongly, connected with profit, not unconnected.\xc2\xa0 And, Ambattha, I too say this, "The Khattiya\xe2\x80\x99s best among those who value clan:\xe2\x80\xa8\xc2\xa0 He with knowledge and conduct is best of Gods and men."'
p503
aS' "But, Reverend Gotama, what is this conduct, what is this knowledge?" "Ambattha, it is not from the standpoint of the attainment of unexcelled knowledge-and-conduct that reputation based on birth and clan is declared, nor on the conceit which says:\xc2\xa0 "You are worthy of me, you are not worthy of me!\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For wherever there is a giving, a taking, or a giving and taking in marriage, there is always this talk and this conceit \xe2\x80\xa6 But those who are enslaved by such things are far from the attainment of the unexcelled knowledge-and-conduct, which is attained by abandoning all such things!"'
p504
aS' "But, Reverend Gotama, what is this conduct, what is this knowledge?" "Ambattha, a Tath\xc3\xa1gata arises in this world, an Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of Gods and humans, enlightened and blessed.\xc2\xa0 He, having realized it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world with its Devas, Maras and Brahmas, its princes and people.\xc2\xa0 He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life. A disciple goes forth and practices the moralities;\xc2\xa0he guards the sense-doors, etc.;\xc2\xa0attains the four jhanas. Thus he develops conduct.\xc2\xa0 He attains various insights, and the cessation of the corruptions\xe2\x80\xa6And beyond this there is no further development of knowledge and conduct that is higher or more perfect.'
p505
aS' "But, Ambattha, in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct, there are four paths of failure.\xc2\xa0 What are they?\xc2\xa0 In the first place, an ascetic or Brahmin who has not managed to gain this unexcelled attainment, takes his carrying-pole and plunges into the depths of the forest thinking:\xc2\xa0 " I will live on windfalls."\xc2\xa0 But in this way he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained.\xc2\xa0 This is the first path of failure.\xc2\xa0 Again, an ascetic or Brahmin, being unable to live on windfalls, takes a spade and basket, thinking:\xc2\xa0 "I will live on tubers and roots."\xe2\x80\xa6This is the second path of failure.\xc2\xa0 Again, an ascetic or Brahmin, being unable to live on tubers and roots, makes a fire-hearth at the edge of a village or small town and sits tending the flame\xe2\x80\xa6This is the third path of failure.\xc2\xa0 Again, an ascetic or Brahmin, being unable to tend the flame, erects a house with four doors at the crossroads thinking:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 "Whatever ascetic or Brahmin arrives from the four quarters, I will honor to the best of my strength and ability."\xc2\xa0 But in this way he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conduct.\xc2\xa0 This is the fourth path of failure.'
p506
aS' "What do you think, Ambattha?\xc2\xa0 Do you and your teacher live in accordance with this unexcelled knowledge and conduct?"\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 "No indeed, Reverend Gotama!\xc2\xa0 Who are my teacher and I in comparison?\xc2\xa0 We are far from it!" "Well then, Ambattha, could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this, go with your carrying-poles into the depths of the forest, intending to live on windfalls?"\xc2\xa0 "No. Indeed, Reverend Gotama." "Well then, Ambattha, could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this, live on tubers and roots, \xe2\x80\xa6 sit tending the flame, \xe2\x80\xa6 erect a house \xe2\x80\xa6?"\xc2\xa0 "No, indeed, Reverend Gotama."'
p507
aS' "And so, Ambattha, not only are you and your teacher incapable of attaining this unexcelled knowledge and conduct, but even the four paths of failure are beyond you.\xc2\xa0 And yet you and your teacher the Brahmin Pokkharasati utter these words:\xc2\xa0 "These shaven little ascetics, menials, black scrapings from Brahma\xe2\x80\x99s foot, what converse can they have with Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas?" \xe2\x80\x93 even though you can\xe2\x80\x99t even manage the duties of one who has failed.\xc2\xa0 See, Ambattha, how your teacher has let you down!" "Ambattha, the Brahmin Pokkharasati lives by the grace and favor of King Pasenadi of Kosala.\xc2\xa0 And yet the King does not allow him to have audience face to face.\xc2\xa0 When he confers with the King it is through a curtain.\xc2\xa0 Why should the King not grant audience face to face to one on whom he has bestowed a proper and blameless source of revenue?\xc2\xa0 See how your teacher has let you down!" "What do you think, Ambattha?\xc2\xa0 Suppose King Pasenadi was sitting on the neck of an elephant or on horseback, or was standing on the chariot-mat, conferring with his ministers and princes about something.\xc2\xa0 And suppose he were to step aside and some workman or workman\xe2\x80\x99s servant were to come along and stand in his place.\xc2\xa0 And standing there he might say:\xc2\xa0 "This is what King Pasenadi of Kosala says!"\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 "Would he be speaking the King\xe2\x80\x99s words, as if he were the King\xe2\x80\x99s equal?"\xc2\xa0 "No, indeed, Reverend Gotama."'
p508
aS' "Well then, Ambattha, it is just the same thing.\xc2\xa0 Those who were, as you say, the first sages of the Brahmins, the makers and expounders of the mantras, whose ancient verses are chanted, pronounced and collected by the Brahmins of today \xe2\x80\x93 Atthaka, Vamaka, Vamadeva, Vessamitta, Yamataggi, Angirasa, Bharadvaja, Vasettha, Kassapa, Bhagu 21\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x93 whose mantras are said to be passed on to you and your teacher:\xc2\xa0 yet you do not thereby become a sage or one practised in the way of a sage \xe2\x80\x93 such a thing is not possible. "What do you think, Ambattha?\xc2\xa0 What have you heard said by Brahmins who are venerable, aged, the teachers of teachers?\xc2\xa0 Those first sages, Attaka, \xe2\x80\xa6 Bhagu \xe2\x80\x93 did they enjoy themselves, well-bathed, perfumed, their hair and beards trimmed, adorned with garlands and wreaths, dressed in white clothes, indulging in the pleasures of the five senses and addicted to them, as you and your teacher do now?"\xc2\xa0 "No, Reverend Gotama." "Or did they eat special fine rice with the black spots removed, with various soups and curries, as you and your teacher do now?"\xc2\xa0 "No, Reverend Gotama." "Or did they amuse themselves with women dressed up in flounces and furbelows, as you and your teacher do now?"\xc2\xa0 "No, Reverend Gotama." "Or did they ride around in chariots drawn by mares with braided tails, that they urged on with long goad-sticks?"\xc2\xa0 "No, Reverend Gotama." "Or did they have themselves guarded in fortified towns with palisades and barricades, by men with long swords \xe2\x80\xa6?"\xc2\xa0 "No, Reverend Gotama." "So, Ambattha, neither you nor your teacher are a sage or one trained in the way of a sage.\xc2\xa0 And now, as for your doubts and perplexities concerning me, we will clarify these by your asking me, and by my answering your questions."'
p509
aS' Then, descending from his lodging, the Lord started to walk up and down, and Ambattha did likewise.\xc2\xa0 And as he walked along with the Lord, Ambattha looked out for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s body.\xc2\xa0 And he could see all of them except for two.\xc2\xa0 He was in doubt and perplexity about two of these marks:\xc2\xa0 he could not make up his mind or be certain about the sheathed genitals or the large tongue. And the Lord, being aware of his doubts, effected by his psychic power that Ambattha could see his sheathed genitals, and then, sticking out his tongue, he reached out to lick both ears and both nostrils, and then covered the whole circle of his forehead with his tongue.\xc2\xa0 Then Ambattha thought:\xc2\xa0'
p510
aS' "The ascetic Gotama is equipped with all the thirty-two marks of a Great Man, complete and with none missing."\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then he said to the Lord:\xc2\xa0 "Reverend Gotama, may I go now?\xc2\xa0 I have much business, much to do."\xc2\xa0 "Ambattha, do what you now think fit."\xc2\xa0 So Ambattha got back into his chariot drawn by mares and departed.'
p511
aS' Meanwhile the Brahmin Pokkharasati had gone outside and was sitting in his park with a large number of Brahmins, just waiting for Ambattha.\xc2\xa0Then Ambattha came to the park.\xc2\xa0 He rode in the chariot as far as it would go, and then continued on foot to where Pokkharasati was, saluted him, and sat down to one side.\xc2\xa0 Then Pokkharasati said: "Well, dear boy, did you see the Reverend Gotama?"\xc2\xa0 "I did, Sir." "And was the Reverend Gotama such as he is reported to be, and not otherwise?\xc2\xa0 And is he of such nature, and not otherwise?"\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 "Sir, he is as he is reported to be, and he is of such nature and not otherwise.\xc2\xa0 He is possessed of the thirty-two marks of a Great Man, all completed, with none missing." "But was there any conversation between you and the ascetic Gotama?"\xc2\xa0 "There was, Sir." "And what was this conversation about?"\xc2\xa0 So Ambattha told Pokkharasati all that had passed between the Lord and himself.'
p512
aS' At this Pokkharasati exclaimed:\xc2\xa0 "Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re a fine little scholar, a fine wise man, a fine expert in the Three Vedas!\xc2\xa0 Anyone going about his business like that ought when he dies, at the breaking-up of the body, to go to the downfall, to the evil path, to ruin, to hell!\xc2\xa0 You have heaped insults on the Reverend Gotama, as a result of which he has brought up more and more things against us!\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re a fine little scholar!"\xc2\xa0 He was so angry and enraged that he kicked Ambattha over, and wanted to start out at once to see the Lord.'
p513
aS' But the Brahmins said:\xc2\xa0 "It is far too late, Sir, to go to see the ascetic Gotama today.\xc2\xa0 The Reverend Pokkharasati should go to see him tomorrow." Then Pokkharasati, having had fine hard and soft food prepared in his own home, set out by the light of torches from Ukkattha for the jungle of Icchanankala.\xc2\xa0 He went by chariot as far as possible, then continued on foot to where the Lord was.\xc2\xa0 Having exchanged courtesies with the Lord, he sat down to one side and said:'
p514
aS' "Venerable Gotama, did not our pupil Ambattha come to see you?"\xc2\xa0 "He did, Brahmin."\xc2\xa0 "And was there any conversation between you?\xc2\xa0 "There was."\xc2\xa0 "And what was this conversation about?" Then the Lord told Pokkharasati all that had passed between him and Ambattha.\xc2\xa0 At this, Pokkharasati said to the Lord:\xc2\xa0 "Reverend Gotama, Ambattha is a young fool.\xc2\xa0 May the Reverend Gotama pardon him."\xc2\xa0 "Brahmin, may Ambattha be happy."'
p515
aS' Then Pokkharasati looked out for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s body and he could see all of them except for two:\xc2\xa0 the sheathed genitals and the large tongue; but the Lord set his mind at rest about these. Then, descending from his lodging, the Lord started to walk up and down, and Pokkharasati did likewise.\xc2\xa0 And as he walked along with the Lord, Pokkharasati looked out for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s body.\xc2\xa0 And he could see all of them except for two.\xc2\xa0 He was in doubt and perplexity about two of these marks:\xc2\xa0 he could not make up his mind or be certain about the sheathed genitals or the large tongue'
p516
aS' And the Lord, being aware of his doubts, effected by his psychic power that Pokkharasati could see his sheathed genitals, and then, sticking out his tongue, he reached out to lick both ears and both nostrils, and then covered the whole circle of his forehead with his tongue.\xc2\xa0 Then Ambattha thought:\xc2\xa0 "The ascetic Gotama is equipped with all the thirty-two marks of a Great Man, complete and with none missing."\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then he said to the Lord:\xc2\xa0 "Reverend Gotama, may I go now?\xc2\xa0 I have much business, much to do."\xc2\xa0 "Pokkharasati, do what you now think fit."\xc2\xa0 And Pokkharasati said to the Lord:\xc2\xa0 "May the Reverend Gotama accept a meal from me today together with his order of monks!"\xc2\xa0 And the Lord consented by silence.'
p517
aS' Seeing his acceptance, Pokkharasati said to the Lord:\xc2\xa0 "It is time, Reverend Gotama, the meal is ready."\xc2\xa0 And the Lord, having dressed in the early morning and taken his robe and bowl, went with his order of monks to Pokkharasati\xe2\x80\x99s residence, and sat down on the prepared seat.\xc2\xa0 Then Pokkharasati personally served the Lord with choice hard and soft food, and the young men served the monks.\xc2\xa0 And when the Lord had taken his hand from the bowl, Pokkharasati sat down to one side on a low stool.'
p518
aS' And as Pokkharasati sat there, the Lord delivered a graduated discourse on generosity, on morality and on heaven, showing the danger, degradation and corruption of sense-desires, and the profit of renunciation.\xc2\xa0 And when the Lord knew that Pokkharasati\xe2\x80\x99s mind was ready, pliable, free from the hindrances, joyful and calm, then he preached a sermon on Dhamma in brief:\xc2\xa0 on suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.\xc2\xa0 And just as a clean cloth from which all stains have been removed receives the dye perfectly, so in the Brahmin Pokkharasati, as he sat there, there arose the pure and spotless Dhamma-eye, and he knew:'
p519
aS' "Whatever things have an origin must come to cessation." And Pokkharasati, having seen, attained, experienced and penetrated the Dhamma, having passed beyond doubt, transcended uncertainty, having gained perfect confidence in the Teacher\xe2\x80\x99s doctrine without relying on others, said:\xc2\xa0 "Excellent, Lord, excellent!\xc2\xa0 It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there.\xc2\xa0 Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways \xe2\x80\xa6 I go with my son, my wife, my ministers and counselors for refuge to the Reverend Gotama, to the Dhamma and to the Sangha.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May the Reverend Gotama accept me as a lay-follower who has taken refuge from this day forth as long as life shall last!\xc2\xa0 And whenever the Reverend Gotama visits other families or lay-followers in Ukkattha, may he also visit the family of Pokkarasati!\xc2\xa0 Whatever young men and maidens are there will revere the Reverend Gotama and rise before him, will give him a seat and water and will be glad at heart, and that will be for their welfare and happiness for a long time." "Well said, Brahmin!"'
p520
aS' I heard thus: At one time the Blessed One lived in Anathapindika\xe2\x80\x99s monastery in Jeta\xe2\x80\x99s grove in Savatthi. The householder Anathapindika was seriously ill and suffering badly at that time. He addressed a certain man and said. \xe2\x80\x98Good man approach the Blessed One, worship the Blessed One for my sake with your head at his feet, and tell. "Venerable sir, the householder Anathapindika is seriously ill. Also approach venerable Shariputra worship venerable Shariputra for my sake with your head at his feet and tell. Venerable sir, the householder Anathapindika is seriously ill, it is good if venerable Shariputra would approach the householder Anathapindika\xe2\x80\x99s house out of compassion."'
p521
aS' That man agreeing, approached the Blessed One, worshipped the Blessed One, sat on a side and said. "Venerable sir, the householder Anathapindika is seriously ill and he worships the Blessed One with his head at the feet of the Blessed One. Then he approached venerable Shariputra, worshipped him, sat on a side and said. "Venerable sir, the householder Anathapindika is seriously ill, he worships venerable Shariputra with his head at the feet of venerable Shariputra and also says, it is good if venerable Shariputra would approach the householder Anathapindika\xe2\x80\x99s house out of compassion."'
p522
aS' Venerable Shariputra accepted the message silently, put on his robes and taking bowl and robes, and accompanied by venerable Ananda as the second recluse, approached the house of Anathapindika. Sitting on the prepared seats venerable Shariputra said. \xe2\x80\x98Householder, how are you feeling? Would you survive? Are the unpleasant feelings decreasing or increasing? Do the feelings show the increasing end or the decreasing end?'
p523
aS' Good sir, Shariputra, I do not feel well and will not survive. My unpleasant feelings are severe and increasing, not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings are increasing until the end. Good sir, Shariputra, my top hurts a lot. I feel as though a strong man was giving me a headdress with a strong cloth. I do not feel well and will not survive. My unpleasant feelings are severe and increasing, not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings are increasing until the end. Good sir, Shariputra, my belly hurts a lot as though a lot of air was turning about in my belly. I feel as though a clever butcher or his apprentice was carving my belly with a sharp butcher\xe2\x80\x99s knife I do not feel well and will not survive. My unpleasant feelings are severe and increasing, not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings are increasing until the end. Good sir, Shariputra, there is a lot burning in my body. I feel as though two strong men taking me by my hands and feet are pulling me to a pit of burning embers and are scorching and burning me. I do not feel well and will not survive. My unpleasant feelings are severe and increasing, not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings are increasing until the end.'

aS' \xe2\x80\x98This pleasant Jeta\xe2\x80\x99s grove the home of sages in the Community Adorned by the king of the Teaching arouses delight in me.

Next day the Blessed One, addressed the Bhikkhus. \xe2\x80\x98Bhikkhus, a certain son of the gods when the night was waning, illuminating Jeta\xe2\x80\x99s grove completely with a resplendent light, approached me worshipped and stood on a side and said.'

aS' When this was said venerable Maha Moggallana said: Friend, Shariputra, a comparison occurs to me. "Friend, say it." "Friend, at one time, I was living in the mountains of Rajagaha. Then one morning wearing robes and taking bowl and robes I entered Rajagaha. At that time Samiiti the chariot maker\xe2\x80\x99s son was bending the circumference of a wheel for an ascetic, the son of Pandu, the earlier chariot maker.\xc2\xa0 Then it occurred to the ascetic, O! If Samiiti\xe2\x80\x99s son corrects these crooked-nesses, slants, and faults and makes the wheel perfect. Whatever crookedness, slant, or fault that the ascetic thought of, that and that he corrected and made the circumference of the wheel perfect. Then the ascetic expressed words of pleasure and said. \'It\'s like he knew the heart with the heart.\' Friend, Shariputra, in the same manner, those making a livelihood without faith, crafty hypocrites, trained deceivers, unsteady, wavering, with loose talk, mental faculties not restrained, not knowing the right amount to partake, not yoked to wakefulness and not desirous of the recluse -ship, not honoring the training, living in abundance and lethargy, unyoked from seclusion, without effort, not mindful and aware, not concentrated, those lacking in wisdom deaf and dumb, hearing this discourse should know the heart with the heart and make repairs.'
p659
aS' As for those sons of clansmen gone forth out of faith, not crafty, not hypocrites, not trained deceivers, steady, without loose talk, mental faculties restrained, yoked to wakefulness, desirous of the recluse-ship, honoring the training, not living in abundance and lethargy, yoked to seclusion with effort, mindful and aware, concentrated and wise, they hearing this discourse of venerable Shariputra, I think should devour the word and thought of it. Good if the co-associates in the holy life raised themselves from demerit and got established in merit." The two great men delighted in each other\xe2\x80\x99s words.'
p660
aS' Thus have I heard: On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jeta\xe2\x80\x99s Grove, Anathapindika\xe2\x80\x99s Park. There the venerable Shariputra addressed the Monks thus, "Friends, Monks." \xe2\x80\x93 "Friend," they replied. The venerable Shariputra said this,'
p661
aS' "Friends, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? Here some person with a blemish does not understand it as it actually is thus, \xe2\x80\x98I have a blemish in myself.\xe2\x80\x99 Here some person with a blemish understands it as it actually is thus, \xe2\x80\x98I have a blemish in myself.\xe2\x80\x99 Here some person with no blemish does not understand it as it actually is thus, \xe2\x80\x98I have no blemish in myself.\xe2\x80\x99 Here some person with no blemish understands it as it actually is thus, \xe2\x80\x98I have no blemish in myself.\xe2\x80\x99'

What is the cause and reason why, of these two persons with no blemish, one is called the inferior man and one is called the superior man?"'
p665
aS' "Herein, friend, when a person with a blemish does not understand it as it is thus, \xe2\x80\x98I have a blemish in myself,\xe2\x80\x99 it can be expected that he will not arouse zeal, make effort, or instigate energy to abandon that blemish, and that he will die with lust, hate, and delusion, with a blemish, with mind defiled. Suppose a bronze dish were brought from a shop or a smithy covered with dirt and stains, and the owners neither used it nor had it cleaned, but put it away in a dusty corner. Would the bronze dish thus get more defiled and stained later on?" \xe2\x80\x93 "Yes, friend." \xe2\x80\x93 "So too, Friend, when a person with a blemish does not understand it as it is actually thus, \xe2\x80\x98I have a blemish in myself,\xe2\x80\x99 it can be expected that he will not arouse zeal, make effort, or instigate energy to abandon that blemish, and that he will die with lust, hate, and delusion, with a blemish, with mind defiled.'

aS' "[4] On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in...and...out focusing on inconstancy; trains himself to breathe in...and...out focusing on dispassion; trains himself to breathe in...and...out focusing on cessation; trains himself to breathe in...and...out focusing on relinquishment: On that occasion the monk remains focused on mental qualities in and of themselves -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- subduing greed and distress with reference to the world. He who sees clearly with discernment the abandoning of greed and distress is one who oversees with equanimity, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in and of themselves -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world.'
p714
aS' "This is how mindfulness of in-and-out breathing is developed and pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination.'

aS' "And how are the four frames of reference developed and pursued so as to bring the seven factors of awakening to their culmination?'
p716
aS' "[1] On whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the body in and of itself -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world, on that occasion his mindfulness is steady and without lapse. When his mindfulness is steady and without lapse, then mindfulness as a factor of awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.'
p717
aS' "[2] Remaining mindful in this way, he examines, analyzes, and comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment. When he remains mindful in this way, examining, analyzing, and coming to a comprehension of that quality with discernment, then analysis of qualities as a factor of awakening becomes aroused.

aS' "[3] In one who examines, analyzes, and comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment, unflagging persistence is aroused. When unflagging persistence is aroused in one who examines, analyzes, and comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment, then persistence as a factor of awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.'
p719
aS' "[4] In one whose persistence is aroused, a rapture not-of-the-flesh arises. When a rapture not-of-the-flesh arises in one whose persistence is aroused, then rapture as a factor of awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.'
p720
aS' "[5] For one who is enraptured, the body grows calm and the mind grows calm. When the body and mind of an enraptured monk grow calm, then serenity as a factor of awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.'
p721
aS' "[6] For one who is at ease -- his body calmed -- the mind becomes concentrated. When the mind of one who is at ease -- his body calmed -- becomes concentrated, then concentration as a factor of awakening becomes aroused.

aS' "[7] He oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity. When he oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity, equanimity as a factor of awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development. [Similarly with the other three frames of reference: feelings, mind, and mental qualities.] "This is how the four frames of reference are developed and pursued so as to bring the seven factors of awakening to their culmination.'
p723
aS' "And how are the seven factors of awakening developed and pursued so as to bring clear knowing and release to their culmination? There is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor of awakening dependent on seclusion ... dispassion ... cessation, resulting in relinquishment. He develops analysis of qualities as a factor of awakening ... persistence as a factor of awakening ... rapture as a factor of awakening ... serenity as a factor of awakening... concentration as a factor of awakening ... equanimity as a factor of awakening dependent on seclusion ... dispassion ... cessation, resulting in relinquishment.'
p724
aS' "This is how the seven factors of awakening, when developed and pursued, bring clear knowing and release to their culmination." That is what the Blessed One said. Glad at heart, the monks delighted in the Blessed One\'s words.'
p725
aS' I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi, in Jeta\'s Grove, Anathapindika\'s monastery. And on that occasion Anathapindika the householder was diseased, in pain, severely ill. Then Anathapindika the householder said to one of his men, "Come, my good man. Go to the Blessed One and, on arrival, pay homage to his feet with your head in my name and say \'Lord, Anathapindika the householder is diseased, in pain, severely ill. He pays homage with his head to the Blessed One\'s feet.\' Then go to Ven. Sariputta and, on arrival, pay homage to his feet with your head in my name and say \'Venerable sir, Anathapindika the householder is diseased, in pain, severely ill. He pays homage with his head to your feet.\' Then say: \'It would be good if Ven. Sariputta would visit Anathapindika\'s home, out of sympathy for him.\'"'
p726
aS' Responding, "As you say, lord," to Anathapindika the householder, the man went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, bowed down to him and sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said, "Lord, Anathapindika the householder is diseased, in pain, severely ill. He pays homage with his head to the Blessed One\'s feet." Then he went to Ven. Sariputta and, on arrival, on arrival, bowed down to him and sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said, \'Venerable sir, Anathapindika the householder is diseased, in pain, severely ill. He pays homage with his head to your feet." Then he said, "It would be good if Ven. Sariputta would visit Anathapindika\'s home, out of sympathy for him."'
p727
aS' Then Ven. Sariputta, taking his bowl & robe, went to the home of Anathapindika the householder with Ven. Ananda as his attendant. On arrival, he sat down on a prepared seat and said to Anathapindika the householder: "I hope you are getting better, householder. I hope you are comfortable. I hope that your pains are lessening and not increasing. I hope that there are signs of their lessening, and not of their increasing."'
p728
aS' [Anathapindika:] "I am not getting better, venerable sir. I am not comfortable. My extreme pains are increasing, not lessening. There are signs of their increasing, and not of their lessening. Extreme forces slice through my head, just as if a strong man were slicing my head open with a sharp sword... Extreme pains have arisen in my head, just as if a strong man were tightening a turban made of tough leather straps around my head... Extreme forces carve up my stomach cavity, just as if a butcher or his apprentice were to carve up the stomach cavity of an ox... There is an extreme burning in my body, just as if two strong men, grabbing a weaker man by the arms, were to roast and broil him over a pit of hot embers. I am not getting better, venerable sir. I am not comfortable. My extreme pains are increasing, not lessening. There are signs of their increasing, and not of their lessening."'
p729
aS' [Ven. Sariputta:] "Then, householder, you should train yourself in this way: \'I won\'t cling to the eye; my consciousness will not be dependent on the eye.\' That\'s how you should train yourself. \'I won\'t cling to the ear... nose... tongue... body; my consciousness will not be dependent on the body.\' ... \'I won\'t cling to the intellect; my consciousness will not be dependent on the intellect.\' That\'s how you should train yourself.'

p739
aS' When this was said, Anathapindika the householder wept and shed tears. Ven. Ananda said to him, "Are you sinking, householder? Are you foundering?" "No, venerable sir. I\'m not sinking, nor am I foundering. It\'s just that for a long time I have attended to the Teacher, and to the monks who inspire my heart, but never before have I heard a talk on the Dhamma like this." "This sort of talk on the Dhamma, householder, is not given to lay people clad in white. This sort of talk on the Dhamma is given to those gone forth."'
p740
aS' "In that case, Ven. Sariputta, please let this sort of talk on the Dhamma be given to lay people clad in white. There are clansmen with little dust in their eyes who are wasting away through not hearing [this] Dhamma. There will be those who will understand it."'
p741
aS" Then Ven. Sariputta and Ven. Ananda, having given this instruction to Anathapindika the householder, got up from their seats and left. Then, not long after they left, Anathapindika the householder died and reappeared in the Tusita heaven. Then Anathapindika the deva's son, in the far extreme of the night, his extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta's Grove, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, bowed down to him and stood to one side. As he was standing there, he addressed the Blessed One with this verse:"
p742
aS" This blessed Jeta's Grove,\xe2\x80\xa8home to the community of seers,\xe2\x80\xa8where there dwells the Dhamma King:\xe2\x80\xa8the source of rapture for me. Action, clear-knowing, & mental qualities,[1]\xe2\x80\xa8virtue, the highest [way of] life:\xe2\x80\xa8\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 through this are mortals purified,\xe2\x80\xa8\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 not through clan or wealth."
p743
aS' Thus the wise,\xe2\x80\xa8seeing their own benefit,\xe2\x80\xa8investigating the Dhamma appropriately,\xe2\x80\xa8should purify themselves right there. As for Sariputta:\xe2\x80\xa8 any monk who has gone beyond,\xe2\x80\xa8 at best can only equal him\xe2\x80\xa8 in discernment, virtue, & calm.'
p744
aS' That is what Anathapindika the deva\'s son said. The Teacher approved. Then Anathapindika the deva\'s son, [knowing,] "The Teacher has approved of me," bowed down to him, circled him three times, keeping him to his right, and then disappeared right there.'
p745
aS' Then when the night had past, The Blessed One addressed the monks: "Last night, monks, a certain deva\'s son in the far extreme of the night, his extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta\'s Grove, came to me and, on arrival, bowed down to me and stood to one side. As he was standing there, he addressed me with this verse:'
p746
aS" This blessed Jeta's Grove,\xe2\x80\xa8home to the community of seers,\xe2\x80\xa8where there dwells the Dhamma King:\xe2\x80\xa8\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 the source of rapture for me.

p748
aS' "That is what the deva\'s son said. And [thinking], \'The Teacher has approved of me,\' he bowed down to me, circled me three times, and then disappeared right there."'
p749
aS' When this was said, Ven. Ananda said to the Blessed One, "Lord, that must have been Anathapindika the deva\'s son. Anathapindika the householder had supreme confidence in Ven. Sariputta." "Very good, Ananda. Very good, to the extent that you have deduced what can be arrived at through logic. That was Anathapindika the deva\'s son, and no one else." That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, Ven. Ananda delighted in the Blessed One\'s words.'
p750
aS' I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Varanasi in the Game Refuge at Isipatana. There he addressed the group of five monks: "Form, monks, is not self. If form were the self, this form would not lend itself to disease. It would be possible to say with regard to form, \'Let this form be thus. Let this form not be thus.\' But precisely because form is not self, form lends itself to disease. And it is not possible to say with regard to form, \'Let this form be thus. Let this form not be thus.\' "Feeling is not self... "Perception is not self... "Mental fabrications are not self... "Consciousness is not self. If consciousness were the self, this consciousness would not lend itself to disease. It would be possible to say with regard to consciousness, \'Let my consciousness be thus. Let my consciousness not be thus.\' But precisely because consciousness is not self, consciousness lends itself to disease. And it is not possible to say with regard to consciousness, \'Let my consciousness be thus. Let my consciousness not be thus.\' "What do you think, monks -- Is form constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord." "And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?" "Stressful, lord." "And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as: \'this is mine. This is my self. This is what I am\'?" "No, lord." "...Is feeling constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."... "...Is perception constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."...

"And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?" "Stressful, lord." "And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as: \'this is mine. This is my self. This is what I am\'?" "No, lord." "Thus, monks, any body whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or external; latent or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: every body is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as: \'this is not mine. This is not my self. This is not what I am.\' "Any feeling whatsoever... "Any perception whatsoever... "Any fabrications whatsoever... "Any consciousness whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as: \'this is not mine. This is not my self. This is not what I am.\' "Seeing thus, the instructed noble disciple grows disenchanted with the body, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception, disenchanted with fabrications, disenchanted with consciousness. Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is fully released. With full release, there is the knowledge, \'Fully released.\' He discerns that \'Birth is depleted, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing! Further for this world.\'" That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the group of five monks delighted at his words. And while this explanation was being given, the hearts of the group of five monks, through not clinging not being sustained, were fully released from fermentation/effluents.'

What if I -- overpowering the world [of the five senses] and having determined my mind -- were to dwell with an awareness that was abundant and enlarged? Having done so, these evil, unskillful mental states -- greed, ill will, and contentiousness -- would not come into being.

aS' When this was said, Ven. Ananda said to the Blessed One: "There is the case, lord, where a monk, having practiced in this way -- \'It should not be, it should not occur to me; it will not be, it will not occur to me. What is, what has come to be, that I abandon\' -- obtains equanimity. Now, would this monk be totally unbound, or not?"'
p780
aS' "A certain such monk might, Ananda, and another might not.\' "What is the cause, what is the reason, whereby one might and another might not?" "There is the case, Ananda, where a monk, having practiced in this way -- (thinking) \'It should not be, it should not occur to me; it will not be, it will not occur to me. What is, what has come to be, that I abandon\' -- obtains equanimity. He relishes that equanimity, welcomes it, remains fastened to it. As he relishes that equanimity, welcomes it, remains fastened to it, his consciousness is dependent on it, is sustained by it (clings to it). With clinging/sustenance, Ananda, a monk is not totally unbound."'
p781
aS' "Being sustained, where is that monk sustained?" "The dimension of neither perception nor non-perception." "Then, indeed, being sustained, he is sustained by the supreme sustenance." "Being sustained, Ananda, he is sustained by the supreme sustenance; for this -- the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception -- is the supreme sustenance. There is [however] the case where a monk, having practiced in this way -- \'It should not be, it should not occur to me; it will not be, it will not occur to me. What is, what has come to be, that I abandon\' -- obtains equanimity. He does not relish that equanimity, does not welcome it, does not remain fastened to it. As does not relish that equanimity, does not welcome it, does not remain fastened to it, his consciousness is not dependent on it, is not sustained by it (does not cling to it). Without clinging/sustenance, Ananda, a monk is totally unbound."'

aS' "It\'s amazing, lord. It\'s astounding. For truly, the Blessed One has declared to us the way to cross over the flood by going from one support to the next. But what is the noble liberation?" "There is the case, Ananda, where a disciple of the noble ones considers this: \'Sensuality here and now; sensuality in lives to come; sensual perceptions here and now; sensual perceptions in lives to come; forms here and now; forms in lives to come; form-perceptions here and now; form-perceptions in lives to come; perceptions of the imperturbable; perceptions of the dimension of nothingness; perceptions of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception: that is an identity, to the extent that there is an identity. This is deathless: the liberation of the mind through lack of clinging/sustenance.\''
p783
aS' "Now, Ananda, I have taught the practice conducive to the imperturbable. I have taught the practice conducive to the dimension of nothingness. I have taught the practice conducive to the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. I have taught the way to cross over the flood by going from one support to the next, the noble liberation. Whatever a teacher should do -- seeking the welfare of his disciples, out of sympathy for them -- that have I done for you. Over there are the roots of trees; over there, empty dwellings. Practice jhana, Ananda. Don\'t be heedless. Don\'t later fall into regret. This is our message to you all." That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, Ven. Ananda delighted in the Blessed One\'s words.'

p950
aS'  if it so happens that  when a disciple of the noble ones obtains these five benefits from wealth  his wealth goes to depletion  the thought occurs to him   even though my wealth has gone to depletion  i have obtained the five benefits that can be obtained from wealth   and he feels no remorse  if it so happens that  when a disciple of the noble ones obtains these five benefits from wealth  his wealth increases  the thought occurs to him   i have obtained the five benefits that can be obtained from wealth  and my wealth has increased   and he feels no remorse  so he feels no remorse in either case  '

aS' punna  i have advised you in short  now in which state will you abide        venerable sir  now that i   m advised in short  i will abide in the sunaparanta state        punna  the people of sunaparanta are rough  if they scold and abuse you  what will you do        venerable sir  if the people of sunaparanta scold and abuse me  it will occur to me  indeed the people of sunaparanta are good  they do not hurt me with their hands        punna  if the people of sunaparanta hurt you with their hands  what will you do        venerable sir  if the people of sunaparanta hurt me with their hands  it will occur to me  indeed the people of sunaparanta are good  they do not hurt me with clods        punna  if the people of sunaparanta hurt you with clods  what will you do        venerable sir  if the people of sunaparanta hurt me with clods  it will occur to me  indeed the people of sunaparanta are good  they do not hurt me with a stick        punna  if the people of sunaparanta hurt you with a stick  what will you do        venerable sir  if the people of sunaparanta hurt me with a stick  it will occur to me  indeed the people of sunaparanta are good  they do not hurt me with a weapon       punna  if the people of sunaparanta hurt you with a weapon  what will you do        venerable sir  if the people of sunaparanta hurt me with a weapon  it will occur to me  indeed the people of sunaparanta are good  they do not end my life with a sharp weapon       punna  if the people of sunaparanta put an end to your life with a sharp weapon  what will you do        venerable sir  if the people of sunaparanta would put an end to my life  it will occur to me thus  there are disciples of the blessed one  who loathing the body and life search for an assassin  here i have got an assassin even without a search      good  punna  it is possible for you to abide in sunaparanta endowed with that appeasement in the teaching  you may do the fit now     venerable punna  delighting in the words of the blessed one  got up from his seat  worshipped the blessed one  and moving with his right side towards the blessed one showed reverence  putting his dwelling in order and taking bowl and robes  he left on a tour to sunaparanta and arrived there in due order  then he abode in that state  venerable punna  during that same rains  brought forth about five hundred male disciples and about five hundred female disciples and realized the three knowledge   s and venerable punna attained final extinction  then many bhikkhus  approached the blessed one  worshipped  sat on a side and said     venerable sir  the clansman who was advised by the blessed one in short has passed away  what are his movements after death    '
p956
aS'    bhikkhus  the clansman punna is wise  he stood on his own in the teaching       he did not worry me about questions in the teaching  he has attained final extinction     the blessed one said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the blessed one '
p957
aS'  in a guest house  o monks  people from the east may take lodgings  or people from the west  north or south  people from the warrior caste may come and take lodgings there  and also brahmans  middle class people and menials   similarly  o monks  there arise in this body various kinds of feelings  there arise pleasant feelings  painful feelings and neutral feelings  worldly feelings that are pleasant  painful or neutral  and unworldly  spiritual  feelings that are pleasant  painful and neutral  '
p958
aS' thus have i heard  once the lord was staying at savatthi  at the mansion of migara   s mother in the east park  and at that time vasettha and bharadvaja were living among the monks  hoping to become monks themselves  and in the evening  the lord rose from his secluded meditation and came out of the mansion  and started walking up and down in its shade  vasettha noticed this and he said to bharadvaja     friend bharadvaja  the lord has come out and is walking up and down  let us approach him  we might be fortunate enough to hear a talk on dhamma from the lord himself     yes  indeed     said bharadvaja  so they went up to the lord  saluted him  and fell into step with him '
p959
aS' then the lord said to vasettha     vasettha  you two are brahmins born and bred  and you have gone forth from the household life into homelessness from brahmin families  do not the brahmins revile and abuse you    '
p960
aS'    indeed  lord  the brahmins do revile and abuse us  they don   t hold back with their usual flood of reproaches        well  vasettha  what kind of reproaches do they fling at you        lord  what the brahmins say is this   the brahmins caste is the highest caste   other castes are base  the brahmin caste is fair  other castes are dark  brahmins are purified  non brahmins are not  the brahmins are the true children of brahma      born from his mouth  born of brahma  heirs of brahma  and you  you have deserted the highest class and gone over to the base class of shave ling petty ascetics  servants  dark fellows born of brahma   s foot  it   s not right  it   s not proper for you to mix with such people   that is the way the brahmins abuse us  lord    '
p961
aS'    then  vasettha  the brahmins have forgotten their ancient tradition when they say that  because we can see brahmin women  the wives of brahmins  who menstruate and become pregnant  have babies  and give milk  and yet these womb born brahmins talk about being born from brahma   s mouth   these brahmins misrepresent brahma  tell lies and earn much demerit '
p962
aS'    there are  vasettha  these four castes  the khattiyas  the brahmins  the merchants and the artisans  and sometimes a khattiya takes life  takes what is not given  commits sexual misconduct  tells lies  indulges in slander  harsh speech or idle chatter  is grasping  malicious  or of wrong views  thus such things as are immoral and considered so  blameworthy and considered so  to be avoided and considered so  ways unbefitting an ariyan and considered so  black with black result and blamed by the wise  are sometimes to found among the khattiyas  and the same applies to brahmins  merchants  and artisans '
p963
aS'    sometimes too  a khattiya refrains from taking life  does not take what is not given  refrains from sexual misconduct  speaks truth  shuns slander  harsh speech or idle chatter  is not grasping  malicious  or of wrong views  thus such things are moral and considered so  blameless and considered so  to be followed and considered so  ways befitting an ariyan and considered so  bright with bright results and praised by the wise  are sometimes found among the khattiyas  and likewise among brahmins  merchants  and artisans     now since both dark and bright qualities  which are blamed and praised by the wise  are scattered indiscriminately among the four castes  the wise do not recognize the claim about the brahmin caste being the highest  why is that  because  vasettha  anyone from the four castes who becomes a monk  an arahant who has destroyed the corruptions  who has lived the life  done what had to be done  laid down the burden  reached the highest goal  destroyed the fetter of becoming  and become emancipated through super knowledge   he is proclaims supreme by virtue of dhamma and not of non dhamma '
p964
aS' dhamma is the best thing for people in this life and the next as well     this illustration will make clear to you how dhamma is best in this world and the next  king pasenadi of kosala knows   the ascetic gotama has gone forth from the neighboring clan of the sakyans   now the sakyans are vassals of the king of kosala  they offer him humble service and salute him  rise and do him homage and pay him fitting service and just as the sakyans offer the king humble service and salute him  rise and do him homage and pay him fitting service so likewise does the king offer humble service to the tath  gata  thinking   if the ascetic gotama is well born  i am ill born  if the ascetic gotama is strong  i am weak  if the ascetic gotama is pleasant to look at  i am ill favored  if the ascetic gotama is influential  i am of little influence   now it is because of honoring the dhamma  making much of the dhamma  esteeming the dhamma  doing reverent homage to the dhamma that king pasenadi does humble service to the tath  gata and pays him fitting service '
p965
aS' dhamma is the best thing for people in this life and the next as well  vasettha  all of you  though of different birth  name  clan and family  who have gone forth from the household life into homelessness  if you are asked who you are  you should reply   we are ascetics  followers of the sakyan       he whose faith in the tath  gata is settled  rooted  established  solid  unshakable by any ascetic or brahmin  any deva or mara or brahma or anyone in the world  can truly say   i am a true son of the blessed lord  born of his mouth  born of dhamma  created by dhamma  an heir of dhamma   why is that  because  vasettha  this designates the tath  gata   the body of dhamma   that is  the body of brahma       or  become dhamma   that is  become brahma          there comes a time  vasettha  when  sooner or later after a long period this world contracts  at a time of contraction  beings are mostly born in the abhassara brahma world  and there they dwell  mind made  feeding on delight  self luminous  moving through the air  glorious   and they stay like that for a very long time  but sooner or later  after a very long period  this world begins to expand again  at a time of expansion  the beings from the abhassara brahma world  having passed away from there  are mostly reborn in this world  here they dwell  mind made  feeding on delight  self luminous  moving through the air  glorious       and they stay like that for a very long time     at that period  vasettha  there was just one mass of water  and all was darkness  blinding darkness  neither moon or sun appeared  no constellations or stars appeared  night and day were not yet distinguished  nor months and fortnights  nor years and seasons  there was no male and female  beings being reckoned just as beings      and sooner or later  after a very long period of time  savory earth spread itself over the waters where those beings were  it looked just like the skin that forms itself over hot milk as it cools  it was endowed with color  smell  and taste  it was the color of fine ghee or butter and it was very sweet  like pure wild honey     then some being of a greedy nature said   i say  what can this be   and tasted the savory earth on its finger  in so doing  it became taken with the flavor  and craving arose in it  then other beings  taking their cue from that one  also tasted the stuff with their fingers  they too were taken with the flavor  and craving arose in them  so they set to with their hands  breaking off pieces of the stuff in order to eat it  and the result was that their self luminance disappeared  and as a result of the disappearance of their self luminance the moon and the sun appeared  night and day were distinguished  months and fortnights appeared  and the year and its seasons  to that extent the world re evolved '
p966
aS'    and those beings continued for a very long time feasting on this savory earth  feeding on it and being nourished by it  and as they did so  their bodies became coarser  and a difference in looks developed among them  some beings became good looking  others ugly  and the good looking ones despised the others  saying   we are better looking than they are   and because they became arrogant and conceited about their looks  the savory earth disappeared  at this they came together and lamented  crying   oh  that flavor  oh  that flavor   and so nowadays when people say   oh  that flavor   when they get something nice  they are repeating an ancient saying without realizing it '
p967
aS'    and then  when the savory earth disappeared  a fungus cropped up  in the manner of a mushroom  it was of good color  smell  and taste  it was the color of fine ghee or butter  and it was very sweet  like pure wild honey  and those beings set to and ate the fungus  and this lasted for a very long time  and as they continued to feed on the fungus  so their bodies become coarser still  and the difference in their looks increased still more  and the good looking ones despised the others   and because they became arrogant and conceited about their looks  the sweet fungus disappeared  next  creepers appeared  shooting up like bamboo   and they too were very sweet  like pure wild honey '
p968
aS'    and those beings set to and fed on those creepers  and as they did so  their bodies became even coarser  and the difference in their looks increased still more   and they became still more arrogant  and so the creepers disappeared too  at this they came together and lamented  crying   alas  our creepers gone  what have we lost   and so now today when people  one being asked why they are upset  say   oh what have we lost   they are repeating an ancient saying without realizing it '
p969
aS'    and then  after the creepers had disappeared  rice appeared in open spaces  free from powder and from husks  fragrant and clean grained  and what they had taken in the evening for supper had grown again and was ripe in the morning  and what they had taken in the morning for breakfast was ripe again by evening  with no sign of reaping  and these beings set to and fed on this rice  and this lasted for a very long time  and as they did so  their bodies became coarser still  and the difference in their looks became even greater  and the females developed female sex organs and the males developed male sex organs  and the women became excessively preoccupied with the men  and the men with the women  owing to this excessive preoccupation with each other  passion was aroused  and their bodies burnt with lust  and later because of this burning  they indulged in sexual activity  but those who saw them indulging threw dust  ashes  or cow dung at them  crying   die  you filthy beast  how can one being do such things to another   just as today  in some districts  when a daughter in law is led out  some people throw dirt at her  some ashes  and some cow dung  without realizing that they are repeating an ancient observance  what was considered bad form in those days is now considered good form '
p970
aS'    and those beings who in those days indulged in sex were not allowed into a village or town for one or two months  accordingly those who indulged for an excessively long period in such immoral practices began to build themselves dwellings so as to indulge under cover '
p971
aS'    now it occurred to one of those beings who was inclined to laziness   well now  why should i be bothered to gather rice in the evening for supper and in the morning for breakfast  why shouldn   t i gather it all at once for both meals   and he did so  then another one came to him and said   come on  lets go rice gathering    no need  my friend  i   ve gathered enough for both meals   then the other  following his example  gathered enough rice for two days at a time  saying   that should be about enough   then another being came to that second one   come on  lets go rice gathering    no need my friend  i   ve gathered enough for two days    the same for four  then eight days   however  when those beings made a store of rice and lived on that  husk powder and husk began to envelop the grain  and where it was reaped it did not grow again  and the cut place showed  and the rice grew in separate clusters '
p972
aS'    and then those beings came together lamenting   wicked ways have become rife among us  at first we were mind made  feeding on delight    all the events are repeated down to the latest development  each fresh change being said to be due to    wicked and unwholesome ways    and the rice grows in separate clusters  so now let us divide up the rice into fields with boundaries   so they did so '
p973
aS'    then  vasettha  one greedy natured being  while watching over his own plot  took another plot that was not given to him  and enjoyed the fruits of it  so they seized hold of him and said   you   ve done a wicked thing  taking another   s plot like that  don   t ever do such a thing again    i won   t   he said  but he did the same thing a second and a third time  again  he was seized and rebuked  and some hit him with their fists  some with stones  and some with sticks  and in this way  vasettha  taking what was not given  and censuring  and lying  and punishment took their origin '
p974
aS'   then those beings came together and lamented the arising of these evil things among them  taking what was not given  censuring  lying  and punishment  and they thought   suppose we were to appoint a certain being who would show anger where anger was due  censure those who deserved it  and banish those who deserved banishment  and in return we would grant him a share of the rice   so they went to the one among them who was the handsomest  the best looking  most pleasant and capable  and asked him to do this for them in return for a share of the rice  and he agreed '
p975
aS'  the people   s choice  is the meaning of maha sammata      which is the first regular title to be introduced   lord of the fields  is the meaning of khattiya  the second such title  and  he gladdens others with dhamma  is the meaning of raja  the third title to be introduced  this  then  vasettha  is the origin of the class of khattiyas  in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them  they originated among the very same beings  like ourselves  no different and in accordance with dhamma  not otherwise '
p976
aS' dhamma is the best thing for people in this life and the next as well     then some beings thought   evil things have appeared among beings  such as taking what is not given  censuring  lying  punishment and banishment  we ought to put aside evil and unwholesome things   and they did so   they put aside evil and unwholesome things  is the meaning of brahmin  which is the first regular title to be introduced for such people  they made leaf huts in forest places and meditated in them  with the smoking fire gone out  with pestle cast aside  gathering alms for their evening and morning meals  they went away to a village  town  or royal city to seek their food  and then they returned to their leaf huts to meditate  people saw this and noted how they meditated   they meditate  is the meaning of jhayaka  which is the second regular title to be introduced '
p977
aS'    however  some of those beings  not being able to meditate in leaf huts  settled around towns and villages and compiled books  people saw them doing this and not meditating     now  these do not meditate  is the meaning of ajjhayaka  which is the third regular title to be introduced  at that time it was regarded as a low designation  but now it is the higher  this  then  vasettha  is the origin of the class of brahmins in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them  their origin was from among the very same beings  like themselves  not different  and in accordance with dhamma  not otherwise '
p978
aS' dhamma is the best thing for people in this life and the next as well     and then  vasettha  some of those beings  having paired off  adopted various trades  and this  various  is the meaning of vessa  which came to be the regular title for such people  this then is the origin of the class of vessas  in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them  their origin was from among these very same beings like themselves  no different  and in accordance with dhamma  not otherwise '
p979
aS'    and then  vasettha  those beings that remained went in for hunting   they are base who live by the chase   and that is the meaning of sudda  which came to be the regular title for such people  this  then  is the origin of the class of suddas     in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them  their origin was from among these very same beings like themselves  no different  and in accordance with dhamma  not otherwise '
p980
aS'    and then  vasettha  it came about that some khattiya  dissatisfied with his own dhamma  went forth from the household life into homelessness  thinking   i will become an ascetic   and a brahmin did likewise  a vessa did likewise  and so did a sudda  and from these four classes the class of ascetics came into existence  their origin was from among these very same beings  like themselves  no different  and in accordance with dhamma  not otherwise '
p981
aS' dhamma is the best thing for people in this life and the next as well      and  vasettha  a khattiya who has led a bad life in body  speech and thought  and who has wrong view will  in consequence of such wrong views and deeds  at the breaking up of the body after death  be reborn in a state of loss  an ill fate  the downfall  the hell state  so too will a brahmin  a vessa or a sudda     likewise  a khattiya who has led a good life in body  speech  and thought  and who has right view will  in consequence of such right view and deeds  at the breaking up of the body after death  be reborn in a good destiny  in a heaven state  so too will a brahmin  a vessa or a sudda '
p982
aS'    and a khattiya who has performed deeds of both kinds in body  speech and thought  and whose view is mixed will  in consequence of such mixed views and deeds  at the breaking up of the body after death  experience both pleasure and pain  so too will a brahmin  a vessa  or a sudda     and a khattiya who is restrained in body  speech and thougth  and who has developed the seven requisites of enlightenment  will attain to parinirvana in this very life  so too will a brahmin  a vessa  or a sudda '
p983
aS' and  vasettha  whoever of these four castes  as a monk  becomes an arahant who has destroyed the corruptions  done what had to be done  laid down the burden  attained to the highest goal  completely destroyed the fetter of becoming  and become liberated by the highest insight  he is declared to be chief among them in accordance with dhamma  and not otherwise '
p984
aS' dhamma   s the best thing for people in this life and the next as well  vasettha  it was brahma sanankumara who spoke this verse  the khattiya   s best among those who value clan  he with knowledge and conduct is best of gods and men  this verse was rightly sung  not wrongly  rightly spoken  not wrongly  connected with profit  not unconnected  i too say  vasettha  the khattiya   s best among those who value clan  he with knowledge and conduct is best of gods and men  thus the lord spoke  and vasettha and bharadvaja were delighted and rejoiced at his words '

aS'  therefore  rahula  you should train yourself   i will purify my bodily acts through repeated reflection  i will purify my verbal acts through repeated reflection  i will purify my mental acts through repeated reflection   that is how you should train yourself   that is what the blessed one said  gratified  ven  rahula delighted in the blessed one s words '
p1155
aS' thus have i heard  once the lord was touring kosala with a large number of monks  some five hundred  and he came to a kosalan brahmin village called icchanankala  and he stayed in the dense jungle of icchanankala  at that time the brahmin pokkharasati was living at ukkhattha  a populous place  full of grass  timber  water and corn  which had been given to him by king pasenadi of kosala as a royal gift with royal powers '
p1156
aS' and pokkharasati heard say   the ascetic gotama  son of the sakyans  who has gone forth from the sakyan clan  is staying in the dense jungle of icchanankala  and concerning that blessed lord a good report has been spread about     this blessed lord is an arahant  a fully enlightened buddha  perfected in knowledge and conduct  a well farer  knower of the worlds  unequalled trainer of men to be tamed  teacher of gods and humans  a buddha  a blessed lord     he proclaims this world with its gods  maras  brahmas  the world of ascetics and brahmins with its princes and people  having come to know it by his own knowledge  he teaches a dhamma that is ending  in the spirit and in the letter  and he displays the fully perfected  thoroughly purified holy life  and indeed it is good to see such arahants  '
p1157
aS' now  at that time pokkharasati had a pupil  the youth ambattha  who was a student of the vedas  who knew the mantras  perfected in the three vedas  a skilled expounder of the rules and rituals  the lore of sounds and meanings and  fifthly  oral tradition  complete in philosophy and the marks of a great man  admitted and accepted by his master in the three vedas with the words   what i know  you know  what you know  i know     and pokkharasati said to ambattha   ambattha  my son  the ascetic gotama  son of the sakyans  who has gone forth from the sakyan clan  is staying in the dense jungle of icchanankala  and concerning that blessed lord a good report has been spread about     this blessed lord is an arahant  a fully enlightened buddha  perfected in knowledge and conduct  a well farer  knower of the worlds  unequalled trainer of men to be tamed  teacher of gods and humans  a buddha  a blessed lord     now you go to see the ascetic gotama and find out whether this report is correct or not  and whether the reverend gotama is as they say or not  in that way we shall put the reverend gotama to the test  '
p1158
aS'  sir  how shall i find out whether the report is true  or whether the reverend gotama is as they say or not    according to the tradition of our mantras  ambattha  the great man who is possessed of the thirty two marks of a great man has only two courses open to him  if he lives the household life he will become a ruler  a wheel turning righteous monarch of the law  conqueror of the four quarters  who has established the security of his realm and is possessed of the seven treasures  these are  the wheel treasure  the elephant treasure  the horse treasure  the jewel treasure  the woman treasure  the householder treasure  and  as a seventh  the counselor treasure  he has more than a thousand sons who are heroes  of heroic stature  conquerors of the hostile army  he dwells having conquered the sea girt land without a stick or sword  by the law  but if he goes forth from the household life into homelessness  then he will become an arahant  a fully enlightened buddha  one who draws back the view from the world  and  ambattha  i am the passer on of the mantras  and you are the receiver  '
p1159
aS'  very good  sir  said ambattha at pokkharasati   s words  and he got up  passed by pokkharasati with his right side  got into his chariot drawn by a mare and  accompanied by a number of young me  headed for the dense jungle of icchanankala  he drove as far as the carriage would go  then alighted and continued on foot '
p1160
aS' at that time a number of monks were walking up and down in the open air  ambattha approached them and said   where is the reverend gotama to be found just now  we have come to see the reverend gotama  '
p1161
aS' the monks considered ambattha and thought   this is ambattha  a youth of good family and a pupil of the distinguished brahmin pokkharasati  the lord would not mind having a conversation with such a young man   and they said to ambattha '
p1162
aS'  that is his dwelling  with the door closed  go quietly up to it  go on to the veranda without haste  cough  and knock on the bolt  the lord will open the door to you  '
p1163
aS' ambattha went up to the dwelling and onto the veranda  coughed  and knocked  the lord opened the door  and ambattha went it  the young men entered  exchanged courtesies with the lord  and sat down to one side  but ambattha walked up and down while the lord sat there  uttered some vague words of politeness  and then stood so speaking before the seated lord   that was considered very rude behavior '
p1164
aS' and the lord said to ambattha   well now  ambattha  would you behave like this if you were talking to venerable and learned brahmins  teachers of teachers  as you do with me  walking and standing while i am sitting  and uttering vague words of politeness  '
p1165
aS'  no  reverend gotama  a brahmin should walk with a walking brahmin  stand with a standing brahmin  sit with a sitting brahmin  sit with a sitting brahmin  and lie down with a brahmin who is lying down  but as for those shaven little ascetics  menials  black scourings from brahmas foot  with them it is fitting to speak just as i do with the reverend gotama  '
p1166
aS'  but  ambattha  you came here seeking something  whatever it was you came for  you should listen attentively to hear about it  ambattha  you have not perfected your training  your conceit of being trained is due to nothing but inexperience  '
p1167
aS' but ambattha was angry and displeased at being called untrained  and he turned on the lord with curses and insults  thinking   the ascetic gotama bears me ill will  he said   reverend gotama  the sakyans are fierce  rough spoken  touchy and violent  being of menial origin  being menials  they do not honor  respect  esteem  revere or pay homage to brahmins  with regard to this it is not proper that they  behave in such a manner and  do not pay homage to brahmins   he is complaining that they do not honor the rigid  caste system  of india     biona webmaster  this was the first time ambattha accused the sakyans of being menials '
p1168
aS'  but  ambattha  what have the sakyans done to you    reverend gotama  once i went to kapilavatthu on some business for my teacher  the brahmin pokkharasati  and i cam to the sakyans meeting hall  and at that time a lot of sakyans were sitting on high seats in their meeting hall  poking each other with their fingers  laughing and playing about together  and it seemed to me that they were just making fun of me  and no offered me a seat  with regard to this  it is not proper that they do not pay homage to the brahmins   this was the second time ambattha accused the sakyans of being menials '
p1169
aS'  but  ambattha  even the quail  that little bird  can talk as she likes in her own nest  kapilavatthu is the sakyans home  ambattha  they do not deserve censure for such a trifle    reverend gotama  there are four castes  the khattiyas  the brahmins  the merchants and the artisans  and of these four castes  three     the khattiyas  the merchants  and the artisans     are entirely subservient to the brahmins   this was the third time ambattha accused the sakyans of being menials '
p1170
aS' then the lord thought   this young man goes too far is abusing the sakyans  suppose i were to ask after his clan name   so he said   ambattha  what is your clan    i am a kanhayan  reverend gotama  '
p1171
aS'  ambattha  in former days  according to those who remember the ancestral lineage  the sakyans were the masters  and you are descended from a slave girl of the sakyans  for the sakyans regard to king okkaka  to whom his queen was dear and beloved  wishing to transfer the kingdom to her son  banished his elder brothers from the kingdom     okkamukha  karandu  hatthiniya  and sinipura  and these  being banished  made their home on the flank of the himalayas beside a lotus pond where there was a growth of teak trees  and for fear of contaminating their stock they cohabitated with their own sisters  then king okkaha asked his ministers and counselors   where are the princes living now   and they told him  at this  king okkaha exclaimed   they are strong as saka trees  these princes  they are real sakyans   and this how the sakyans go their well known name  and the king was the ancestor of the sakyans '
p1172
aS'  now king okkaha has a slave girl called disa  who gave birth to a kanha  dirty  black  child  the black thing  when it was born  exclaimed   wash me  mother  bath me  mother  deliver me from this dirt and i will bring you profit   because  ambattha  just as people today use the term hobgoblin as a term of abuse  so in those days did they say kanha  and they said   as soon as he was born  he spoke  he is born a kanha  a hobgoblin   that is how  in former days according to those who remember the ancestral lineage  the sakyans were the masters  and you are descended from a slave girl of the sakyans  '
p1173
aS' on hearing this  the young men said   reverend gotama  do not humiliate ambattha too much with talk of his being descended from a slave girl  ambattha is well born  of a good family  he is very learned  he is well spoken  a scholar  well able to hold his own in this discussion with the reverend gotama  '
p1174
aS' then the lord said to the young men   if you consider that ambattha is ill born  not of good family  unlearned  ill spoke  unable to hold his own in this discussion with the ascetic gotama  then let ambattha be silent  and you conduct this discussion with me  but if you think he is well born  of a good family  he is very learned  he is well spoken  a scholar  able to hold his own  then you be quiet and let him discuss with me  '
p1175
aS'  ambattha is well born  reverend gotama  of a good family  he is very learned  he is well spoken  a scholar  able to hold his own  we shall be silent  he shall continue   then the lord said to ambattha   ambattha  i have a fundamental question for you  which you will not like to answer  if you don   t answer  or if you evade the issue  if you keep silent or go away  your head will split into seven pieces  what do you think  ambattha  have you heard from old and venerable brahmins  teachers of teachers  where the kanhayans came from  or who was their ancestor  '
p1176
aS' at this  ambattha remained silent  and the lord said   answer me now  ambattha  this is not the time for silence  whoever  ambattha  does not answer a fundamental question put to him by a tath  gata by the third asking has his head split into seven pieces    this is a pre buddhist mythos that  as rhys davids observes  never comes to anything  '
p1177
aS' and at that moment vajrapani the yaksha   this god is also called  indra   he is ready to make good on the mytho mentioned above  the old gods are supporting the new religion  vajrapani also appears as a bodhisattva in later mahayana sutras   holding up a huge iron club  flaming  ablaze and glowing  up in the sky just above ambattha was thinking   if this young man does not answer a proper question put to him by the blessed lord by the third time of asking  i   ll split his head into seven pieces   the lord saw vajrapani  and so did ambattha  and at the sight  ambattha was terrified and unnerved  his hairs stood on end  and he sought protection  shelter  and safety from the lord  crouching down close to the lord  he said   what did the reverend gotama say  may the reverend gotama repeat what he said  '
p1178
aS'  what do you think  ambattha  have you heard from old and venerable brahmins  teachers of teachers  where the kanhayans came from  or who was their ancestor    yes  i have heard it just as the reverend gotama said  that is where the kanhayans came from  he was their ancestor '
p1179
aS' hearing this  the young men made a loud noise and clamor   so ambattha is ill born  not of a good family  born of a slave girl of the sakyans  and the sakyans are ambattha   s masters  we disparages the ascetic gotama  thinking he was not speaking the truth  '
p1180
aS' then the lord thought   it is too much  the way these young men humiliate ambattha for being the ancestor of a slave girl  i must get him out of this   so he said to the young men   don   t disparage ambattha too much for being the ancestor of a slave girl  that kahna was a mighty sage  known more commonly today as krishna   biona webmaster   he went to the south country  learnt the mantras of the brahmins there  and then went to king okkaka and asked for his daughter maddarupi  and okkaka  furiously angry  exclaimed   so this fellow  the son of a slave girl  wants my daughter   and put an arrow to his bow  but he unable either to shoot to arrow or to withdraw it  then the ministers and the counselors came together to the sage kanha and said   spare the king  reverend sir  spare the king  '
p1181
aS'  the king will be safe  but if he looses the arrow downwards  the earth will quake as far as his kingdom extends    reverend sir  spare the king  spare the land    the king and the land will be safe  but if he looses the arrow upwards  as for as his realm extends the god will not let it rain for seven years   according to rhys davids this is a bluff  as the spell could only stop the discharge of an arrow  '
p1182
aS'  reverend sir  spare the king  spare the land  and may the god let it rain    the king and the land will be safe  and the god will let it rain  but if the king points the arrow at the crown prince  the prince will be completely safe  '
p1183
aS'  then the ministers exclaimed   let king okkaka point the arrow at the crown prince  the prince will be perfectly safe   the king did so and the prince was unharmed  then king okkaka  terrified and fearful of divine punishment gave away his daughter to maddarupi  so  young men  do not disparage ambattha too much for being the ancestor of a slave girl  that kahna was a mighty sage  '
p1184
aS' then the lord said   ambattha  what do you think  suppose a khattiya youth were to wed a brahmin maiden  and there was a son of the union  would that son of a khattiya youth and a brahmin maiden receive a seat and water from the brahmins    he would  reverend gotama      would they allow him to eat at funeral rites  at rice offerings  at sacrifices  or as a guest    they would  reverend gotama    would they teach him mantras or not    they would  reverend gotama    would they keep their women covered or uncovered    uncovered  reverend gotama    but would the khattiyas sprinkle him with the khattiya consencration    no  reverend gotama    why not    because  reverend gotama  he is not well born on his mothers side    what do you think  ambattha  suppose a brahmin youth were to wed a khattiya maiden  and there was a son of the union  would that son of a khattiya youth and a brahmin maiden receive a seat and water from the brahmins    he would  reverend gotama    he would  reverend gotama    would they allow him to eat at funeral rites  at rice offerings  at sacrifices  or as a guest    they would  reverend gotama    would they teach him mantras or not    they would  reverend gotama    would they keep their women covered or uncovered    uncovered  reverend gotama    but would the khattiyas sprinkle him with the khattiya consecration    no  reverend gotama    why not    because  reverend gotama  he is not well born on his fathers side    so  ambattha  the khattiyas  through a man taking a woman or a woman taking a man  are senior to the brahmins  what do you think  ambattha  take the case of a brahmin who  for some reason  has had his head shaved by the brahmins  has been punished with a bag of ashes and banished from the country or the city    would he receive a seat and water from the brahmins      no  reverend gotama    would they allow him to eat at funeral rites  at rice offerings  at sacrifices  or as a guest      no  reverend gotama    would they teach him mantras  or not      they would not  reverend gotama    would they keep their women covered or uncovered      covered  reverend gotama    what do you think  ambattha    take the case of a khattiya who  for some reason  had his head shaved by the khattiyas  has been punished with a bag of ashes and banished from the country or the city    would he receive a seat and water from the brahmins      he would  reverend gotama    would they keep their women covered or uncovered      uncovered  reverend gotama    but that khattiya has so far reached the extreme of humiliation that he has     been banished from the country or the city    so even if a khattiya has suffered extreme humiliation  he is superior and the brahmins inferior   ambittha  this verse was pronounced by brahma sanankumara   the khattiya   s best among those who value clan      he with knowledge and conduct is best of gods and men    this verse was rightly sung  not wrongly  rightly spoken  not wrongly  connected with profit  not unconnected    and  ambattha  i too say this   the khattiya   s best among those who value clan       he with knowledge and conduct is best of gods and men  '
p1185
aS'  but  reverend gotama  what is this conduct  what is this knowledge    ambattha  it is not from the standpoint of the attainment of unexcelled knowledge and conduct that reputation based on birth and clan is declared  nor on the conceit which says     you are worthy of me  you are not worthy of me      for wherever there is a giving  a taking  or a giving and taking in marriage  there is always this talk and this conceit     but those who are enslaved by such things are far from the attainment of the unexcelled knowledge and conduct  which is attained by abandoning all such things  '
p1186
aS'  but  reverend gotama  what is this conduct  what is this knowledge    ambattha  a tath  gata arises in this world  an arahant  fully enlightened buddha  endowed with wisdom and conduct  well farer  knower of the worlds  incomparable trainer of men to be tamed  teacher of gods and humans  enlightened and blessed    he  having realized it by his own super knowledge  proclaims this world with its devas  maras and brahmas  its princes and people    he preaches the dhamma which is lovely in its beginning  lovely in its middle  lovely in its ending  in the spirit and in the letter  and displays the fully perfected and purified holy life  a disciple goes forth and practices the moralities   he guards the sense doors  etc    attains the four jhanas  thus he develops conduct    he attains various insights  and the cessation of the corruptions   and beyond this there is no further development of knowledge and conduct that is higher or more perfect '
p1187
aS'  but  ambattha  in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct  there are four paths of failure    what are they    in the first place  an ascetic or brahmin who has not managed to gain this unexcelled attainment  takes his carrying pole and plunges into the depths of the forest thinking      i will live on windfalls     but in this way he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained    this is the first path of failure    again  an ascetic or brahmin  being unable to live on windfalls  takes a spade and basket  thinking     i will live on tubers and roots     this is the second path of failure    again  an ascetic or brahmin  being unable to live on tubers and roots  makes a fire hearth at the edge of a village or small town and sits tending the flame   this is the third path of failure    again  an ascetic or brahmin  being unable to tend the flame  erects a house with four doors at the crossroads thinking       whatever ascetic or brahmin arrives from the four quarters  i will honor to the best of my strength and ability     but in this way he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conduct    this is the fourth path of failure '
p1188
aS'  what do you think  ambattha    do you and your teacher live in accordance with this unexcelled knowledge and conduct        no indeed  reverend gotama    who are my teacher and i in comparison    we are far from it    well then  ambattha  could you and your teacher  being unable to gain this  go with your carrying poles into the depths of the forest  intending to live on windfalls      no  indeed  reverend gotama    well then  ambattha  could you and your teacher  being unable to gain this  live on tubers and roots      sit tending the flame      erect a house          no  indeed  reverend gotama  '
p1189
aS'  and so  ambattha  not only are you and your teacher incapable of attaining this unexcelled knowledge and conduct  but even the four paths of failure are beyond you    and yet you and your teacher the brahmin pokkharasati utter these words     these shaven little ascetics  menials  black scrapings from brahma   s foot  what converse can they have with brahmins learned in the three vedas       even though you can   t even manage the duties of one who has failed    see  ambattha  how your teacher has let you down    ambattha  the brahmin pokkharasati lives by the grace and favor of king pasenadi of kosala    and yet the king does not allow him to have audience face to face    when he confers with the king it is through a curtain    why should the king not grant audience face to face to one on whom he has bestowed a proper and blameless source of revenue    see how your teacher has let you down    what do you think  ambattha    suppose king pasenadi was sitting on the neck of an elephant or on horseback  or was standing on the chariot mat  conferring with his ministers and princes about something    and suppose he were to step aside and some workman or workman   s servant were to come along and stand in his place    and standing there he might say     this is what king pasenadi of kosala says        would he be speaking the king   s words  as if he were the king   s equal      no  indeed  reverend gotama  '
p1190
aS'  well then  ambattha  it is just the same thing    those who were  as you say  the first sages of the brahmins  the makers and expounders of the mantras  whose ancient verses are chanted  pronounced and collected by the brahmins of today     atthaka  vamaka  vamadeva  vessamitta  yamataggi  angirasa  bharadvaja  vasettha  kassapa  bhagu          whose mantras are said to be passed on to you and your teacher    yet you do not thereby become a sage or one practised in the way of a sage     such a thing is not possible   what do you think  ambattha    what have you heard said by brahmins who are venerable  aged  the teachers of teachers    those first sages  attaka      bhagu     did they enjoy themselves  well bathed  perfumed  their hair and beards trimmed  adorned with garlands and wreaths  dressed in white clothes  indulging in the pleasures of the five senses and addicted to them  as you and your teacher do now      no  reverend gotama    or did they eat special fine rice with the black spots removed  with various soups and curries  as you and your teacher do now      no  reverend gotama    or did they amuse themselves with women dressed up in flounces and furbelows  as you and your teacher do now      no  reverend gotama    or did they ride around in chariots drawn by mares with braided tails  that they urged on with long goad sticks      no  reverend gotama    or did they have themselves guarded in fortified towns with palisades and barricades  by men with long swords          no  reverend gotama    so  ambattha  neither you nor your teacher are a sage or one trained in the way of a sage    and now  as for your doubts and perplexities concerning me  we will clarify these by your asking me  and by my answering your questions  '
p1191
aS' then  descending from his lodging  the lord started to walk up and down  and ambattha did likewise    and as he walked along with the lord  ambattha looked out for the thirty two marks of a great man on the lord   s body    and he could see all of them except for two    he was in doubt and perplexity about two of these marks    he could not make up his mind or be certain about the sheathed genitals or the large tongue  and the lord  being aware of his doubts  effected by his psychic power that ambattha could see his sheathed genitals  and then  sticking out his tongue  he reached out to lick both ears and both nostrils  and then covered the whole circle of his forehead with his tongue    then ambattha thought   '
p1192
aS'  the ascetic gotama is equipped with all the thirty two marks of a great man  complete and with none missing       then he said to the lord     reverend gotama  may i go now    i have much business  much to do      ambattha  do what you now think fit     so ambattha got back into his chariot drawn by mares and departed '
p1193
aS' meanwhile the brahmin pokkharasati had gone outside and was sitting in his park with a large number of brahmins  just waiting for ambattha   then ambattha came to the park    he rode in the chariot as far as it would go  and then continued on foot to where pokkharasati was  saluted him  and sat down to one side    then pokkharasati said   well  dear boy  did you see the reverend gotama      i did  sir    and was the reverend gotama such as he is reported to be  and not otherwise    and is he of such nature  and not otherwise        sir  he is as he is reported to be  and he is of such nature and not otherwise    he is possessed of the thirty two marks of a great man  all completed  with none missing    but was there any conversation between you and the ascetic gotama      there was  sir    and what was this conversation about     so ambattha told pokkharasati all that had passed between the lord and himself '
p1194
aS' at this pokkharasati exclaimed     well  you   re a fine little scholar  a fine wise man  a fine expert in the three vedas    anyone going about his business like that ought when he dies  at the breaking up of the body  to go to the downfall  to the evil path  to ruin  to hell    you have heaped insults on the reverend gotama  as a result of which he has brought up more and more things against us    you   re a fine little scholar     he was so angry and enraged that he kicked ambattha over  and wanted to start out at once to see the lord '
p1195
aS' but the brahmins said     it is far too late  sir  to go to see the ascetic gotama today    the reverend pokkharasati should go to see him tomorrow   then pokkharasati  having had fine hard and soft food prepared in his own home  set out by the light of torches from ukkattha for the jungle of icchanankala    he went by chariot as far as possible  then continued on foot to where the lord was    having exchanged courtesies with the lord  he sat down to one side and said '
p1196
aS'  venerable gotama  did not our pupil ambattha come to see you      he did  brahmin      and was there any conversation between you     there was      and what was this conversation about   then the lord told pokkharasati all that had passed between him and ambattha    at this  pokkharasati said to the lord     reverend gotama  ambattha is a young fool    may the reverend gotama pardon him      brahmin  may ambattha be happy  '
p1197
aS' then pokkharasati looked out for the thirty two marks of a great man on the lord   s body and he could see all of them except for two    the sheathed genitals and the large tongue  but the lord set his mind at rest about these  then  descending from his lodging  the lord started to walk up and down  and pokkharasati did likewise    and as he walked along with the lord  pokkharasati looked out for the thirty two marks of a great man on the lord   s body    and he could see all of them except for two    he was in doubt and perplexity about two of these marks    he could not make up his mind or be certain about the sheathed genitals or the large tongue'
p1198

noble truth of the cessation of suffering  and what  monks  is the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering  it is this  the noble eightfold path  namely  right understanding  right thought  right speech  right action  right livelihood  right effort  right awareness and right concentration  and what  monks  is right understanding  it is this  monks  the knowledge of suffering  the knowledge of the arising of suffering  the knowledge of the cessation of suffering  the knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of suffering  this  monks  is called right understanding  and what  monks  is right thought  thoughts of renunciation  thoughts that are free from aversion and thoughts that are free from violence  this  monks  is called right thought  and

right livelihood  here  monks  a noble disciple having given up wrong ways of livelihood earns his livelihood by right means  this  monks  is called right livelihood  and what  monks  is right effort  here  monks  a monk generates the will to prevent the arising of unarisen evil unwholesome mental states  he makes strong effort  stirs up his energy  applies his mind to it and strives  to eradicate those evil unwholesome mental states that have arisen in him  he generates the will  makes strong effort  stirs up his energy  applies his mind to it and strives  to develop wholesome mental states that have not yet arisen in him  he generates will  makes strong effort  stirs up his energy  applies his mind to it and strives  to maintain wholesome mental states that have arisen in him  not to let them fade away  to multiply them and bring them to full maturity and to full development  he generates will  makes strong effort  stirs up his energy  applies his mind to it and strives  this  monks  is called right effort  and what  monks  is right awareness  here  monks  a monk dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence  observing body in body  having removed craving and aversion towards the world  of mind and matter   he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence  observing sensations in sensations  having removed craving and aversion towards the world  of mind and matter   he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence  observing mind in mind  having removed craving and aversion towards the world  of mind and matter   he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence  observing mental contents in mental contents  having removed craving and aversion towards the world  of mind and matter   this  monks  is called right awareness  and what  monks  is right concentration  here monks  a monk  detached from craving  detached from unwholesome mental states  enters into the first absorption  born of detachment  accompanied by initial and sustained application of the mind and filled with rapture and bliss and he dwells therein  with the subsiding of initial and sustained application of the mind and gaining inner tranquillity and oneness of mind he enters into the second absorption  born of concentration  free from initial

contents in mental contents as regards the four noble truths  indeed  monks  whoever practises this fourfold establishing of awareness in this manner for seven years  he may expect one of two results  in this very life highest wisdom or  if a substratum of aggregates remains  the stage of non returner  let alone seven years  monks  should any person practise this fourfold establishing of awareness

developed and made much in this manner knowledge of the path gets completed    the blessed one said thus and those bhikkhu delighted in the words of the blessed one  i heard thus  at one time the blessed one was living in the kuru country  in the hamlet named kammassadhamma  the blessed one addressed the bhikkhus from there   bhikkhus  sensuality is impermanent  useless  false  a stupid thing and a deception  it is prattle and foolish talk  sensuality here and now and hereafter  sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter  all these are the domain of death  the pasture of death  the evil mind with sensuality is led to greed  anger and quarrels bhikkhus the noble disciple reflects  sensuality is impermanent  useless  false  a stupid thing and a deception  it is prattle and foolish talk  sensuality here and now and hereafter  sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter  all these are the domain of death  the pasture of death  the evil mind with sensuality is led to greed  anger and quarrels  what if i develop the mind grown great and much  above the material world  then there will be no greed  anger  or quarrels  when these are dispelled my mind will be significant  limitless and well developed  fallen to this method  when developed much  the mind  partakes pleasure in that sphere or abides in imperturbability here and now  or with wisdom it is released  after death  there is a possibility that the led on  consciousness should reach imperturbability  bhikkhus  i say  this is the first suitability to reach imperturbability  again bhikkhus  the noble disciple reflects  sensuality here and now and hereafter  sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter  whatever matter of the four primary elements  is on account of this held on matter  fallen to this method  when developed much  the mind  partakes pleasure in that sphere or abides in imperturbability here and now  or with wisdom it is released  after death  there is a possibility that the led on  consciousness should reach imperturbability  bhikkhus  i say  this is the second suitability to reach imperturbability  again bhikkhus  the noble disciple reflects  sensuality here and now and

you  ananda  these are the roots of trees  and these are the empty houses  ananda  concentrate and do not have remorse later  this is our advice to you  the blessed one said those words and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the blessed one   monks  these two slander the tath  gata  which two  he who explains what was not said or spoken by the tath  gata as said or spoken by the tath  gata and he who explains what was said or spoken by the tath  gata as not said or spoken by the tath  gata  these are two who slander the tath  gata   i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near rajagaha in the bamboo grove  the squirrels  sanctuary  then prince abhaya went to nigantha nataputta and on arrival  having bowed down to him  sat to one side  as he was sitting there  nigantha nataputta said to him   come  now  prince  refute the words of the contemplative gotama  and this admirable report about you will spread afar   the words of the contemplative gotama    so mighty  so powerful    were refuted by prince abhaya     but how  venerable sir  will i refute the words of the contemplative gotama    so mighty  so powerful    come now  prince  go to the contemplative gotama and on arrival say this   venerable sir  would the tath  gata say words that are un endearing and disagreeable to others   if the contemplative gotama  thus asked  answers   the tath  gata would say words that are un endearing and disagreeable to others   then you should say   then how is there any difference between you  venerable sir  and run of the mill people  for even run of the mill people say words that are un endearing and disagreeable to others   but if the contemplative gotama  thus asked  answers   the tath  gata would not say words that are un endearing and disagreeable to others   then you should say   then how  venerable sir  did you say of devadatta that  devadatta is headed for destitution  devadatta is headed for hell  devadatta will boil for an eon  devadatta is incurable    for devadatta was upset and disgruntled at those words of yours   when the contemplative gotama is asked this two pronged question by you  he won t be able to swallow it down or spit it up  just as if a two horned chestnut     were stuck in a man s throat  he would not be able to swallow it down or spit it up  in the same way  when the contemplative gotama is asked this two pronged question by you  he won t be able to swallow it down or spit it up   responding   as you say  venerable sir   prince abhaya got up from his seat  bowed down to nigantha nataputta  circumambulated him  and then went to the blessed one  on arrival  he bowed down to the blessed one and sat to one side  as he was sitting there  he glanced up at the sun and thought   today is not the time to refute the blessed one s words  tomorrow in my own home i will overturn the blessed one s words   so he said to the blessed one   may the blessed one  together with three others  acquiesce to my offer of tomorrow s meal   the blessed one acquiesced with silence  then prince abhaya  understanding the blessed one s acquiescence  got up from his seat  bowed down to the blessed one  circumambulated him  and left  then  after the night had passed  the blessed one early in the morning put on his robes and  carrying his bowl and outer robe  went to prince abhaya s home  on arrival  he sat down on a seat made ready  prince abhaya  with his own hand  served and satisfied the blessed one with fine staple and non staple foods  then  when the blessed one had eaten and had removed his hand from his bowl  prince abhaya took a lower seat and sat down to one side  as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one   venerable sir  would the tath  gata say words that are un endearing and disagreeable to others    prince  there is no categorical yes or no answer to that    then right here  venerable sir  the niganthas are destroyed    but prince  why do you say   then right here  venerable sir  the niganthas are destroyed     just yesterday  venerable sir  i went to nigantha nataputta and    he said to me    come now  prince  go to the contemplative gotama and on arrival say this   venerable sir  would the tath  gata say words that are un endearing and disagreeable to others      just as if a two horned chestnut were stuck in a man s throat  he would not be able to swallow it down or spit it up  in the same way  when the contemplative gotama is asked this two pronged question by you  he won t be able to swallow it down or spit it up    now at that time a baby boy was lying face up on the prince s lap  so the blessed one said to the prince   what do you think  prince  if this young boy  through your own negligence or that of the nurse  were to take a stick or a piece of gravel into its mouth  what would you do    i would take it out  venerable sir  if i couldn t get it out right away  then holding its head in my left hand and crooking a finger of my right  i would take it out  even if it meant drawing blood  why is that  because i have sympathy for the young boy    in the same way  prince      in the case of words that the tath  gata knows to be un factual  untrue  unbeneficial  or  not connected with the goal   un endearing and disagreeable to others  he does not say them      in the case of words that the tath  gata knows to be factual  true  unbeneficial  un endearing and disagreeable to others  he does not say them      in the case of words that the tath  gata knows to be factual  true  beneficial  but un endearing and disagreeable to others  he has a sense of the proper time for saying them      in the case of words that the tath  gata knows to be un factual  untrue  unbeneficial  but endearing and agreeable to others  he does not say them      in the case of words that the tath  gata knows to be factual  true  unbeneficial  but endearing and agreeable to others  he does not say them      in the case of words that the tath  gata knows to be factual  true  beneficial  and endearing and agreeable to others  he has a sense of the proper time for saying them  why is that  because the tath  gata has sympathy for living beings    venerable sir  when wise nobles or priests  householders or contemplatives  having formulated questions  come to the tath  gata and ask him  does this line of reasoning appear to his awareness beforehand     if those who approach me ask this  i    thus asked    will answer in this way     or does the tath  gata come up with the answer on the spot    in that case  prince  i will ask you a counter question  answer as you see fit  what do you think  are you skilled in the parts of a chariot    yes  venerable sir  i am skilled in the parts of a chariot    and what do you think  when people come and ask you   what is the name of this part of the chariot   does this line of reasoning appear to your awareness beforehand     if those who approach me ask this  i    thus asked    will answer in this way     or do you come up with the answer on the spot    venerable sir  i am renowned for being skilled in the parts of a chariot  all the parts of a chariot are well known to me  i come up with the answer on the spot    in the same way  prince  when wise nobles or priests  householders or contemplatives  having formulated questions  come to the tath  gata and ask him  he comes up with the answer on the spot  why is that  because the property of the dhamma is thoroughly penetrated by the tath  gata  from his thorough penetration of the property of the dhamma  he comes up with the answer on the spot   when this was said  prince abhaya said to the blessed one   magnificent  venerable sir  magnificent  just as if he were to place upright what was overturned  to reveal what was hidden  to show the way to one who was lost  or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms  in the same way has the blessed one    through many lines of reasoning    made the dhamma clear  i go to the blessed one for refuge  to the dhamma  and to the sangha of monks  may the blessed one remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge  from this day forward  for life   then janussoni the brahman went to the blessed one and  on arrival  exchanged courteous greetings with him  after an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies  he sat to one side  as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one   i am of the view and opinion that there is no one who  subject to death  is not afraid or in terror of death   the blessed one said   brahman

certainty with regard to the true dhamma   he grieves and is tormented  weeps  beats his breast  and grows delirious  this  too  is a person who  subject to death  is afraid and in terror of death

reveal what was hidden  to show the way to one who was lost  or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms  in the same way has master gotama    through many lines of reasoning    made the dhamma clear  i go to master gotama for refuge  to the dhamma  and to the sangha of monks  may master gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge  from this day forward  for life   i heard thus  at one time the blessed one was living in the squirrels    sanctuary in the bamboo grove in rajagaha  then the king   s son abhaya approached niganthanataputta worshipped and sat on a side  niganthanataputta said to the king   s son      come  prince  arouse a dispute with the recluse gotama  when you argue with a person like the recluse gotama  so powerful and so majestic  your fame will spread    venerable sir  how could i arouse a dispute with the recluse gotama  so powerful and so majestic    come prince  approach the recluse gotama and ask  venerable sir  does the thus gone one say  such words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others   when asked thus if  the recluse gotama replies   yes  prince  the thus gone one  says words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others   then you should say   venerable sir  what is the difference between you and the ordinary one  the ordinary one says words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others   if he says   prince  the thus gone one does not say words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others   then you should say    venerable sir  why did you say these words to devadatta  devadatta is in loss  in hell in much difficulty  till the end of the world cycle  on account of those words devadatta was displeased   when this forked question  is asked  he would not be able to swallow it or spit it out  a man with an iron ring stuck in the throat would not be able to swallow or spit it out  to the king   s son abhaya prince abhaya then  said to the blessed     one  venerable sir  does the thus gone one say words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others        prince  in certain respects i do not       venerable sir we heard this from the nigantas        prince  why do you say  we heard this from the nigantas        here venerable sir  i approached niganthanaataputta worshipped him and sat on a side  then niganthanaataputta said to me  come prince  approach the recluse gotama and ask  venerable sir  does the thus gone one say  words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others  when asked thus if the recluse gotama replies  the thus gone one says words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others  then you say  if that is so venerable sir  what is the difference between you and the ordinary one  the ordinary one says words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others  if he says  prince  the thus gone one does not say words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others  ask him  venerable sir  why did you say these words to devadatta  devadatta is in loss  in hell  in much difficulty till the end of the world cycle  on account of those words devadatta was displeased  when this forked question is asked  he would not be able to swallow it or spit it out  like a man with an iron ring stuck in the throat would not be able to swallow or spit it out  in the same manner when this forked question is asked  he would not be able to swallow it or spit it out     at that time a baby boy  a toddler was seated on the lap of prince abhaya  the blessed one said     prince  on account of some negligence of yours or the nurse  if this baby swallows a piece of stick or a stone  what would you do        venerable sir  i will pull it out  if i could not take it out quickly  taking hold of the head with the left hand  would pull it out with the finger of the right hand  even while blood is spilt  what is the reason  venerable sir  there is my compassion for the baby        prince  in the same manner  when the thus gone one knows that words are not true  not conductive to good  and are disagreeable and distasteful to others  the thus gone one does not say those words  when the thus gone one knows that words are not true  not conductive to good  disagreeable and distasteful to others  the thus gone one does not say those words  when the thus gone one knows that the words are true  are conductive to good  disagreeable and distasteful to others  the thus gone one waits for the right time to explain those words  when the thus gone one knows that the words are true  conductive to good  agreeable and tasteful to others  the thus gone one does not say those words  when the thus gone one knows that the words are true  not conductive to good  agreeable and tasteful to others  the thus one does not say those words  when the thus gone one knows that the words are true conductive to good  agreeable and tasteful to others the thus gone one waits for the right time to explain those words  what is the reason  prince there is compassion for beings in the thus gone one        venerable sir  wise men  warriors  or brahmins  or householders  or recluses concoct a question  approach the thus gone one and question him  venerable sir  does the blessed one  know before hand  they would approach me and ask these questions  does it occur to the thus gone one  when asked thus i will reply thus  or does the reply at that moment occur to the thus gone one        then prince  i will ask a question from you on this  you may reply  as it pleases you  prince  are you clever about the large and small parts of a chariot        yes  venerable sir  i   m clever in the large and small parts of a chariot        prince  if someone approaches you and asks  about the large and small parts of the chariot  would you before hand know these people will approach me and ask about these parts of the chariot  and when asked this and other thing i will reply thus and thus        venerable sir  i   m a charioteer and i   m clever in the large and small parts of the chariot  when asked the reply occurs to me that moment        prince  in the same manner  these wiseman  warriors  brahmins  householders  and recluses concoct a question and approach the thus gone one  and question him  the answer occurs to the thus gone one instantly  what is the reason   the element of the teaching is thoroughly known to the thus gone one  so the reply to the question occurs to the thus gone one that moment     when this was said  prince abhaya said thus to the blessed one     now i understand it  venerable sir  it is as though something over turned is reinstated  something covered is made manifest  as though the path was told to someone who had lost his way  it is like an oil lamp lighted in the dark  for those who have sight to see forms  in various ways the blessed one has explained the teaching  now i take refuge in the blessed one  in the teaching and the community of bhikkhus  may i

quickly plants the seed  having quickly planted the seed  he quickly lets in the water and then lets it out   these are the three urgent duties of a farming householder  now  that farming householder does not have the power or might to say   may my crops spring up today  may the grains appear tomorrow  and may they ripen the next day   but when the time has come  the farming householder s crops spring up  the grains appear  and they ripen   in the same way  there are these three urgent duties of a monk  which three  the undertaking of heightened virtue  the undertaking of heightened mind  the undertaking of heightened discernment  these are the three urgent duties of a monk  now  that monk does not have the power or might to say   may my mind be released from fermentations through lack of clinging sustenance today or tomorrow or the next day   but when the time has come  his mind is released from fermentations through lack of clinging sustenance   thus  monks  you should train yourselves   strong will be our desire for the undertaking of heightened virtue  strong will be our desire for the undertaking of heightened mind  strong will be our desire for the undertaking of heightened discernment   that s how you should train yourselves   thus have i heard  on one occasion the blessed one was living at savatthi in jeta   s grove  anathapindika   s park  now a number of bhikkhus were sitting in the assembly hall  where they had met together on returning from their alms round  after their meal  when this discussion arose among them   it is wonderful  friends  it is marvelous  how mighty and powerful is the tath  gata  for he is able to know about the buddhas of the past   who attained to final nibb  na  cut the tangle of proliferation  broke the cycle  ended the round  and surmounted all suffering   that for those blessed ones their birth was thus  their names were thus  their clans were thus  their virtue was thus  their state of concentration was thus  their wisdom was thus  their abiding in attainments was thus  their deliverance was thus   when this was said  the venerable ananda told the bhikkhus   friends  tath  gatas are wonderful and have superb qualities  tath  gatas are marvelous and have splendid qualities   however  their discussion was interrupted  for the blessed one rose from meditation when it was evening  went to the assembly hall  and sat down on a seat made ready  then he addressed the bhikkhus thus   bhikkhus  for what discussion are you sitting together here now  and what was your discussion that was interrupted

blessed one   i heard and learned this from the blessed one   s own lips     for the whole of his life span the bodhisattva remained in the tushita heaven     this too i remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the blessed one    i heard and learned this from the blessed one   s own lips     mindful and fully aware the bodhisattva passed away from the tushita heaven and descended into his mother   s womb     this too i remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the blessed one   i heard and learned this from the blessed one   s own lips     when the bodhisattva passed away from the tushita heaven and descended into his mother   s womb  then a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendor of the gods appeared in the world with its gods  its maras  and its brahmas  in this generation with its recluses and brahmans  with its princes and its people  and even in those abysmal world interspaces of vacancy  gloom  and utter darkness  where the moon and the sun  mighty and powerful as they are  cannot make the their light prevail   there too a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendor of the gods appeared  and the beings born there perceived each other by that light   so other beings  indeed  have appeared here   and this ten thousand fold world system shook and quaked and trembled  and there too a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendor of the gods appeared     this too i remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the blessed one   i heard and learned this from the blessed one   s own lips     when the bodhisattva had descended into his mother   s womb  four young deities came to guard him at the four quarters so that no humans or non humans or anyone at all could harm the bodhisattva or his mother     this too i remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the blessed one   i heard and learned this from the blessed one   s own lips     when the bodhisattva had descended into his mother   s womb  she became intrinsically virtuous  refraining from killing living beings  from taking what is not given  from misconduct in sensual pleasures  from false speech  and from wines  liquors  and intoxicants  which are the basis of negligence     this too i remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the blessed one   i heard and learned this from the blessed one   s own lips     when the bodhisattva had descended into his mother   s womb  no sensual thought arose in her concerning men  and she was inaccessible to any man having a lustful mind     this too i remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the blessed one   i heard and learned this from the blessed one   s own lips     when the bodhisattva had descended into his mother   s womb  she obtained the five cords of sensual pleasure  and furnished and endowed with them  she enjoyed herself with them     this too i remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the blessed one   i heard and learned this from the blessed one   s own lips     when the bodhisattva had descended into his mother   s womb  no kind of affliction arose in her  she was blissful and free from bodily fatigue  she saw the bodhisattva within her womb with all his limbs  lacking no faculty  suppose a blue  yellow  red  white  or brown thread were strung through a fine beryl gem of purest water  eight faceted  well cut  and a man with good sight were to take it in his hand and review it thus   this is a fine beryl gem of purest water  eight faceted  well cut  and through it is strung a blue  yellow  red  white  or brown thread   so too when the bodhisattva had descended into his mother   s womb   she saw the bodhisattva within her womb with all his limbs  lacking no faculty     this too i remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the blessed one   i heard and learned this from the blessed one   s own lips     seven days after the birth of the bodhisattva  his mother died and reappeared in the tushita heaven     this too i remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the blessed one   i heard and learned this from the blessed one   s own lips     other women give birth after carrying the child in the womb for nine or ten months  but not so the bodhisattvas mother  the bodhisattvas mother gave birth after carrying him in her womb for exactly ten months     this too i remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the blessed one   i heard and learned this from the blessed one   s own lips     other women give birth seated or lying down  but not so the bodhisattvas mother  the bodhisattvas mother gave birth to him standing up     this too i remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the blessed one   i heard and learned this from the blessed one   s own lips     when the bodhisattva came forth from his mother   s womb  first gods received him  then human beings  this too i remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the blessed one   i heard and learned this from the blessed one   s own lips  when the bodhisattva came forth from his mothers womb  he did not touch the earth  the four young gods received him and set him before his mother saying   rejoice  oh queen  a son of great power has been born to you   this too i remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the blessed one   i heard and learned this from the blessed one   s own lips     when the bodhisattva came forth from his mother   s womb  he came forth unsullied  un smeared by water or humors or blood or any kind of impurity  clean and unsullied  suppose there were a gem placed on kasi cloth  then the gem would not smear the cloth or the cloth the gem  why is that  because of the purity of both  so too when the bodhisattva came forth   clean and unsullied     this too i remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the blessed one   i heard and learned this from the blessed one   s own lips     when the bodhisattva came forth from his mother   s womb  two jets of water appeared to pour from the sky  one cool and one warm  for bathing the bodhisattva and his mother     this too i remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the blessed one   i heard and learned this from the blessed one   s own lips   as soon as the bodhisattva was born  he stood firmly with his feet on the ground  then he took seven steps north  and with a white parasol held over him  he surveyed each quarter and uttered the words of the leader of the herd   i am the highest in the world  i am the best in the world  i am the foremost in the world  this is my last birth  now there is no renewal of being for me  this too i remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the blessed one   i heard and learned this from the blessed one   s own lips     when the bodhisattva came forth from his mother   s womb  then a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendor of the gods appeared in the world with its gods  its maras  and its brahmas  in this generation with its recluses and brahmins  with its princes and its people  and even in those abysmal world inter spaces of vacancy  gloom  and utter darkness  where the moon and the sun  mighty and powerful as they are  cannot make their light prevail     there too a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendor of the gods appeared  and the beings born there perceived each other by that light   so other beings  indeed  have appeared here   and this ten thousand fold world system shook and quaked and trembled  and there too a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendor of the gods appeared     that when the bodhisattva came forth from his mother   s womb  then a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendor of the gods appeared    this too i remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the blessed one      that being so  ananda

as the tamed mind  the tamed mind is indeed a thing tractable monks  i know not of any other single thing so conducive to great loss as the untamed mind  the untamed mind indeed conduces to great loss  untamed     monks  i know not of any other single thing so conducive to great profit as the tamed mind  the tamed mind indeed conduces to great profit   monks  i know not of any other single thing that brings such woe as the mind that is untamed  uncontrolled  unguarded and unrestrained  such a mind indeed brings great woe   monks  i know not of any other single thing that brings such bliss as the mind that is tamed  controlled  guarded and restrained  such a mind indeed brings great bliss   i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near savatthi in jeta s grove  anathapindika s monastery  then a certain devata  in the far extreme of the night  her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of jeta s grove  went to the blessed one and  on arrival  having bowed down to him  stood to one side  as she was standing there  she recited these verses in the blessed one s presence   when a house is on fire   the vessel salvaged   is the one that will be of use      not the one left there to burn  so when the world is on fire   with aging and death    one should salvage one s wealth by giving      what   s given is well salvaged  what s given bears fruit as pleasure     what isn t given does not      thieves take it away  or kings      it gets burnt by fire or lost  then in the end   one leaves the body   together with one s possessions    knowing this  the intelligent man   enjoys possessions and gives  having enjoyed and given   in line with his means    un censured he goes   to the heavenly state  thus have i heard  the blessed one was once living at gayaslsa in gaya with a thousand bhikkhus  there he addressed the bhikkhus  bhikkhus  all is burning  and what is all that is burning  bhikkhus  the eye is burning  visible forms are burning  visual consciousness is burning  visual impression is burning  also whatever sensation  pleasant or painful or neither painful  nor pleasant  arises on account of the visual impression  that too is burning  burning with what  burning with the fire of craving  with the fire of hate  with the fire of delusion  i say it is burning with birth  aging and death  with sorrows  with lamentations  with pains  with grief   s  and with despairs  the ear is burning  sounds are burning  auditory consciousness is burning  auditory impression is burning  also whatever sensation  pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant  arises on account of the auditory impression  that too is burning  burning with what  burning with the fire of craving    the nose is burning  odors are burning  olfactory consciousness is burning  olfactory impression is burning  also whatever sensation  pleasant or painful  or neither painful nor pleasant  arises on account of the olfactory impression  that too is burning  burning with what  burning with the fire of craving    the tongue is burning  favors are burning  gustative consciousness is burning  gustative impression is burning  also whatever sensation  pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant  arises on account of the gustative impression  that too is burning  burning with what  burning with the fire of craving    the body is burning  tangible things are burning  tactile consciousness is burning  tactile impression is burning  also whatever sensation  pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant  arises on account of the tactile sensation  that too is burning  burning with what  burning with the fire of craving    the mind is burning  mental objects  ideas  etc   are burning  mental consciousness is burning  mental impression is burning  also whatever sensation  pleasant o painful or neither painful nor pleasant  arises on account of the mental impression is burning  burning with what  burning with the fire of craving  with the fire of hate  with the fire of delusion  i say it is burning with birth  aging and death  with sorrows  with lamentations  with pains  with grief   s  and with despairs  bhikkhus  a learned and noble disciple  who sees things thus  becomes dispassionate with regard to the eye  becomes dispassionate with regard to visible forms  becomes dispassionate with regard to the visual consciousness  becomes dispassionate with regard to the visual impression  also whatever sensation  pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant  arises on account of the visual impression  with regard to that too he becomes dispassionate  he becomes dispassionate with regard to the ear  with regard to sounds    he becomes dispassionate with regard to the nose    with regard to odors    he becomes dispassionate with regard to the tongue   with regard to favors     he becomes dispassionate with regard to the body    with regard to tangible things    he becomes dispassionate with regard to the mind    with regard to mental consciousness  becomes dispassionate with regard to mental impression  also whatever sensation  pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant  arises on account of mental impression  with regard to that too he becomes dispassionate  being dispassionate  he becomes detached  through detachment he is liberated  when liberated there is knowledge that he is liberated  and he knows  birth is exhausted  the holy life has been lived  what has to be done is done  there is no more left to be done on this account  this the blessed one said  the bhikkhus were glad  and they rejoiced at his words  while this exposition was being delivered  the minds of those thousand bhikkhus were liberated from impurities  without attachment    i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at varanasi in gaya  at gaya head  with       monks  there he addressed the monks   monks  the all is aflame  what all is aflame  the eye is aflame  forms are aflame  visual consciousness is aflame  visual contact is aflame  and whatever there is that arises in dependence on visual contact  experienced as pleasure  pain  or neither pleasure nor pain that too is aflame  aflame with what  aflame with the fire of passion  the fire of aversion  the fire of delusion  aflame  i say  with birth  ageing death  with sorrows  lamentations  pains  grief   s despairs   the ear is aflame  sounds are aflame     the nose is aflame  odors are aflame     the tongue is aflame  flavors are aflame     the body is aflame  tactile sensations are aflame     the intellect is aflame  ideas are aflame  mental consciousness is aflame  mental contact is aflame  and whatever there is that arises in dependence on mental contact  experienced as pleasure  pain  or neither pleasure nor pain that too is aflame  aflame with what  aflame with the fire of passion  the fire of aversion  the fire of delusion  aflame  i say  with birth  ageing    death  with sorrows  lamentations  pains  grief s   despairs   seeing thus  the instructed noble disciple grows disenchanted with the eye  disenchanted with forms  disenchanted with visual consciousness  disenchanted with visual contact  and whatever there is that arises in dependence on visual contact  experienced as pleasure  pain  or neither pleasure nor pain  he grows disenchanted with that too   he grows disenchanted with the ear     he grows disenchanted with the nose     he grows disenchanted with the tongue     he grows disenchanted with the body    he grows disenchanted with the intellect  disenchanted with ideas  disenchanted with mental consciousness  disenchanted with mental contact  and whatever there is that arises in dependence on mental contact  experienced as pleasure  pain  or neither pleasure nor pain  he grows disenchanted with that too  disenchanted  he becomes dispassionate  through dispassion  he is released  with release  there is the knowledge   released   he discerns that   birth is depleted  the holy life fulfilled  the task done  there is nothing further for this world    that is what the blessed one said  glad at heart  the monks delighted at his words  and while this explanation was being given  the hearts of the       monks  through no clinging  not being sustained   were released from the mental effluents  then anathapindika the householder went to the blessed one and  on arrival  having bowed down to him  sat to one side  as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him   there are these five benefits that can be obtained from wealth  which five   there is the case where the disciple of the noble ones    using the wealth earned through his efforts and enterprise  amassed through the strength of his arm  and piled up through the sweat of his brow  righteous wealth righteously gained    provides himself with pleasure and satisfaction  and maintains that pleasure rightly  he provides his mother and father with pleasure and satisfaction  and maintains that pleasure rightly  he provides his children  his wife  his slaves  servants  and assistants with pleasure and satisfaction  and maintains that pleasure rightly  this is the first benefit that can be obtained from wealth   furthermore  the disciple of the noble ones    using the wealth earned through his efforts and enterprise  amassed through the strength of his arm  and piled up through the sweat of his brow  righteous wealth righteously gained    provides his friends and associates with pleasure and satisfaction  and maintains that pleasure rightly  this is the second benefit that can be obtained from wealth   furthermore  the disciple of the noble ones    using the wealth earned through his efforts and enterprise  amassed through the strength of his arm  and piled up through the sweat of his brow  righteous wealth righteously gained    wards off from calamities coming from fire  flood  kings  thieves  or hateful heirs  and keeps himself safe  this is the third benefit that can be obtained from wealth   furthermore  the disciple of the noble ones    using the wealth earned through his efforts and enterprise  amassed through the strength of his arm  and piled up through the sweat of his brow  righteous wealth righteously gained    performs the five oblations  to relatives  guests  the dead  kings  and devas  this is the fourth benefit that can be obtained from wealth   furthermore  the disciple of the noble ones    using the wealth earned through his efforts and enterprise  amassed through the strength of his arm  and piled up through the sweat of his brow  righteous wealth righteously gained    institutes offerings of supreme aim  heavenly  resulting in happiness  leading to heaven  given to priests and contemplatives who abstain from intoxication and heedlessness  who endure all things with patience and humility  each taming himself  each restraining himself  each taking himself to unbinding  this is the fifth benefit that can be obtained from wealth   if it so happens that  when a disciple of the noble ones obtains these five benefits from wealth  his wealth goes to depletion  the thought occurs to him   even though my wealth has gone to depletion  i have obtained the five benefits that can be obtained from wealth   and he feels no remorse  if it so happens that  when a disciple of the noble ones obtains these five benefits from wealth  his wealth increases  the thought occurs to him   i have obtained the five benefits that can be obtained from wealth  and my wealth has increased   and he feels no remorse  so he feels no remorse in either case    my wealth has been enjoyed    my dependents supported    protected from calamities by me    i have given supreme offerings   and performed the five oblations    i have provided for the virtuous    the restrained    followers of the holy life    for whatever aim a wise householder   would desire wealth    that aim i have attained    i have done what will not lead to future distress     when this is recollected by a mortal    a person established in the dhamma of the noble ones    he is praised in this life   and  after death  rejoices in heaven  i heard thus  at one time the blessed one was living in anathapindika   s monastery  in jeta   s grove in savatthi  then venerable punna getting up from his seclusion in the evening  approached the blessed one  worshipped sat on a side and said     venerable sir  it is good  if i   m advised in short  so that i could abide alone and secluded  zealous to dispel diligently        then punna  listen  i will advice you     venerable punna agreed and the blessed said     punna  there are pleasing  agreeable  forms cognizable by eye consciousness  arousing fondness  attachment and sensual desires  the bhikkhu  delights  welcomes and clings to them  and interest arises  punna  i say  the arising of interest is the arising of unpleasantness  there are pleasing agreeable sounds cognizable by ear consciousness  scents cognizable by nose consciousness  tastes cognizable by tongue consciousness  touches cognizable by body consciousness and ideas cognizable by mind consciousness  arousing fondness  attachment and sensual desires  the bhikkhu  delights  welcomes and clings to them  and interest arises  punna  i say  the arising of interest is the arising of unpleasantness  punna  there are pleasing  agreeable  forms  cognizable by eye consciousness  arousing fondness  attachment and sensual desires  the bhikkhu  does not delight welcome and cling to them  and the interest ceases  punna  i say  the cessation of interest is the cessation of unpleasantness  there are pleasing  agreeable  sounds cognizable by ear consciousness  scents cognizable by nose consciousness  tastes cognizable by tongue consciousness  touches cognizable by body consciousness and ideas cognizable by mind consciousness  arousing fondness  attachment and sensual desires  the bhikkhu  does not delight  welcome and cling to them  and so the interest ceases  punna  i say  the cessation of interest is the cessation of unpleasantness  punna  i have advised you in short  now in which state will you abide        venerable sir  now that i   m advised in short  i will abide in the sunaparanta state        punna  the people of sunaparanta are rough  if they scold and abuse you  what will you do        venerable sir  if the people of sunaparanta scold and abuse me  it will occur to me  indeed the people of sunaparanta are good  they do not hurt me with their hands        punna  if the people of sunaparanta hurt you with their hands  what will you do        venerable sir  if the people of sunaparanta hurt me with their hands  it will occur to me  indeed the people of sunaparanta are good  they do not hurt me with clods        punna  if the people of sunaparanta hurt you with clods  what will you do        venerable sir  if the people of sunaparanta hurt me with clods  it will occur to me  indeed the people of sunaparanta are good  they do not hurt me with a stick        punna  if the people of sunaparanta hurt you with a stick  what will you do        venerable sir  if the people of sunaparanta hurt me with a stick  it will occur to me  indeed the people of sunaparanta are good  they do not hurt me with a weapon       punna  if the people of sunaparanta hurt you with a weapon  what will you do        venerable sir  if the people of sunaparanta hurt me with a weapon  it will occur to me  indeed the people of sunaparanta are good  they do not end my life with a sharp weapon       punna  if the people of sunaparanta put an end to your life with a sharp weapon  what will you do        venerable sir  if the people of sunaparanta would put an end to my life  it will occur to me thus  there are disciples of the blessed one  who loathing the body and life search for an assassin  here i have got an assassin even without a search      good  punna  it is possible for you to abide in sunaparanta endowed with that appeasement in the teaching  you may do the fit now     venerable punna  delighting in the words of the blessed one  got up from his seat  worshipped the blessed one  and moving with his right side towards the blessed one showed reverence  putting his dwelling in order and taking bowl and robes  he left on a tour to sunaparanta and arrived there in due order  then he abode in that state  venerable punna  during that same rains  brought forth about five hundred male disciples and about five hundred female disciples and realized the three knowledge   s and venerable punna attained final extinction  then many bhikkhus  approached the blessed one  worshipped  sat on a side and said     venerable sir  the clansman who was advised by the blessed one in short has passed away  what are his movements after death        bhikkhus  the clansman punna is wise  he stood on his own in the teaching       he did not worry me about questions in the teaching  he has attained final extinction     the blessed one said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the blessed one   in a guest house  o monks  people from the east may take lodgings  or people from the west  north or south  people from the warrior caste may come and take lodgings there  and also brahmans  middle class people and menials   similarly  o monks  there arise in this body various kinds of feelings  there arise pleasant feelings  painful feelings and neutral feelings  worldly feelings that are pleasant  painful or neutral  and unworldly  spiritual  feelings that are pleasant  painful and neutral   thus have i heard  once the lord was staying at savatthi  at the mansion of migara   s mother in the east park  and at that time vasettha and bharadvaja were living among the monks  hoping to become monks themselves  and in the evening  the lord rose from his secluded meditation and came out of the mansion  and started walking up and down in its shade  vasettha noticed this and he said to bharadvaja     friend bharadvaja  the lord has come out and is walking up and down  let us approach him  we might be fortunate enough to hear a talk on dhamma from the lord himself     yes  indeed     said bharadvaja  so they went up to the lord  saluted him  and fell into step with him  then the lord said to vasettha     vasettha  you two are brahmins born and bred  and you have gone forth from the household life into homelessness from brahmin families  do not the brahmins revile and abuse you        indeed  lord  the brahmins do revile and abuse us  they don   t hold back with their usual flood of reproaches        well  vasettha  what kind of reproaches do they fling at you        lord  what the brahmins say is this   the brahmins caste is the highest caste   other castes are base  the brahmin caste is fair  other castes are dark  brahmins are purified  non brahmins are not  the brahmins are the true children of brahma      born from his mouth  born of brahma  heirs of brahma  and you  you have deserted the highest class and gone over to the base class of shave ling petty ascetics  servants  dark fellows born of brahma   s foot  it   s not right  it   s not proper for you to mix with such people   that is the way the brahmins abuse us  lord        then  vasettha  the brahmins have forgotten their ancient tradition when they say that  because we can see brahmin women  the wives of brahmins  who menstruate and become pregnant  have babies  and give milk  and yet these womb born brahmins talk about being born from brahma   s mouth   these brahmins misrepresent brahma  tell lies and earn much demerit     there are  vasettha  these four castes  the khattiyas  the brahmins  the merchants and the artisans  and sometimes a khattiya takes life  takes what is not given  commits sexual misconduct  tells lies  indulges in slander  harsh speech or idle chatter  is grasping  malicious  or of wrong views  thus such things as are immoral and considered so  blameworthy and considered so  to be avoided and considered so  ways unbefitting an ariyan and considered so  black with black result and blamed by the wise  are sometimes to found among the khattiyas  and the same applies to brahmins  merchants  and artisans     sometimes too  a khattiya refrains from taking life  does not take what is not given  refrains from sexual misconduct  speaks truth  shuns slander  harsh speech or idle chatter  is not grasping  malicious  or of wrong views  thus such things are moral and considered so  blameless and considered so  to be followed and considered so  ways befitting an ariyan and considered so  bright with bright results and praised by the wise  are sometimes found among the khattiyas  and likewise among brahmins  merchants  and artisans     now since both dark and bright qualities  which are blamed and praised by the wise  are scattered indiscriminately among the four castes  the wise do not recognize the claim about the brahmin caste being the highest  why is that  because  vasettha  anyone from the four castes who becomes a monk  an arahant who has destroyed the corruptions  who has lived the life  done what had to be done  laid down the burden  reached the highest goal  destroyed the fetter of becoming  and become emancipated through super knowledge   he is proclaims supreme by virtue of dhamma and not of non dhamma  dhamma is the best thing for people in this life and the next as well     this illustration will make clear to you how dhamma is best in this world and the next  king pasenadi of kosala knows   the ascetic gotama has gone forth from the neighboring clan of the sakyans   now the sakyans are vassals of the king of kosala  they offer him humble service and salute him  rise and do him homage and pay him fitting service and just as the sakyans offer the king humble service and salute him  rise and do him homage and pay him fitting service so likewise does the king offer humble service to the tath  gata  thinking   if the ascetic gotama is well born  i am ill born  if the ascetic gotama is strong  i am weak  if the ascetic gotama is pleasant to look at  i am ill favored  if the ascetic gotama is influential  i am of little influence   now it is because of honoring the dhamma  making much of the dhamma  esteeming the dhamma  doing reverent homage to the dhamma that king pasenadi does humble service to the tath  gata and pays him fitting service  dhamma is the best thing for people in this life and the next as well  vasettha  all of you  though of different birth  name  clan and family  who have gone forth from the household life into homelessness  if you are asked who you are  you should reply   we are ascetics  followers of the sakyan       he whose faith in the tath  gata is settled  rooted  established  solid  unshakable by any ascetic or brahmin  any deva or mara or brahma or anyone in the world  can truly say   i am a true son of the blessed lord  born of his mouth  born of dhamma  created by dhamma  an heir of dhamma   why is that  because  vasettha  this designates the tath  gata   the body of dhamma   that is  the body of brahma       or  become dhamma   that is  become brahma          there comes a time  vasettha  when  sooner or later after a long period this world contracts  at a time of contraction  beings are mostly born in the abhassara brahma world  and there they dwell  mind made  feeding on delight  self luminous  moving through the air  glorious   and they stay like that for a very long time  but sooner or later  after a very long period  this world begins to expand again  at a time of expansion  the beings from the abhassara brahma world  having passed away from there  are mostly reborn in this world  here they dwell  mind made  feeding on delight  self luminous  moving through the air  glorious       and they stay like that for a very long time     at that period  vasettha  there was just one mass of water  and all was darkness  blinding darkness  neither moon or sun appeared  no constellations or stars appeared  night and day were not yet distinguished  nor months and fortnights  nor years and seasons  there was no male and female  beings being reckoned just as beings      and sooner or later  after a very long period of time  savory earth spread itself over the waters where those beings were  it looked just like the skin that forms itself over hot milk as it cools  it was endowed with color  smell  and taste  it was the color of fine ghee or butter and it was very sweet  like pure wild honey     then some being of a greedy nature said   i say  what can this be   and tasted the savory earth on its finger  in so doing  it became taken with the flavor  and craving arose in it  then other beings  taking their cue from that one  also tasted the stuff with their fingers  they too were taken with the flavor  and craving arose in them  so they set to with their hands  breaking off pieces of the stuff in order to eat it  and the result was that their self luminance disappeared  and as a result of the disappearance of their self luminance the moon and the sun appeared  night and day were distinguished  months and fortnights appeared  and the year and its seasons  to that extent the world re evolved     and those beings continued for a very long time feasting on this savory earth  feeding on it and being nourished by it  and as they did so  their bodies became coarser  and a difference in looks developed among them  some beings became good looking  others ugly  and the good looking ones despised the others  saying   we are better looking than they are   and because they became arrogant and conceited about their looks  the savory earth disappeared  at this they came together and lamented  crying   oh  that flavor  oh  that flavor   and so nowadays when people say   oh  that flavor   when they get something nice  they are repeating an ancient saying without realizing it     and then  when the savory earth disappeared  a fungus cropped up  in the manner of a mushroom  it was of good color  smell  and taste  it was the color of fine ghee or butter  and it was very sweet  like pure wild honey  and those beings set to and ate the fungus  and this lasted for a very long time  and as they continued to feed on the fungus  so their bodies become coarser still  and the difference in their looks increased still more  and the good looking ones despised the others   and because they became arrogant and conceited about their looks  the sweet fungus disappeared  next  creepers appeared  shooting up like bamboo   and they too were very sweet  like pure wild honey     and those beings set to and fed on those creepers  and as they did so  their bodies became even coarser  and the difference in their looks increased still more   and they became still more arrogant  and so the creepers disappeared too  at this they came together and lamented  crying   alas  our creepers gone  what have we lost   and so now today when people  one being asked why they are upset  say   oh what have we lost   they are repeating an ancient saying without realizing it     and then  after the creepers had disappeared  rice appeared in open spaces  free from powder and from husks  fragrant and clean grained  and what they had taken in the evening for supper had grown again and was ripe in the morning  and what they had taken in the morning for breakfast was ripe again by evening  with no sign of reaping  and these beings set to and fed on this rice  and this lasted for a very long time  and as they did so  their bodies became coarser still  and the difference in their looks became even greater  and the females developed female sex organs and the males developed male sex organs  and the women became excessively preoccupied with the men  and the men with the women  owing to this excessive preoccupation with each other  passion was aroused  and their bodies burnt with lust  and later because of this burning  they indulged in sexual activity  but those who saw them indulging threw dust  ashes  or cow dung at them  crying   die  you filthy beast  how can one being do such things to another   just as today  in some districts  when a daughter in law is led out  some people throw dirt at her  some ashes  and some cow dung  without realizing that they are repeating an ancient observance  what was considered bad form in those days is now considered good form     and those beings who in those days indulged in sex were not allowed into a village or town for one or two months  accordingly those who indulged for an excessively long period in such immoral practices began to build themselves dwellings so as to indulge under cover     now it occurred to one of those beings who was inclined to laziness   well now  why should i be bothered to gather rice in the evening for supper and in the morning for breakfast  why shouldn   t i gather it all at once for both meals   and he did so  then another one came to him and said   come on  lets go rice gathering    no need  my friend  i   ve gathered enough for both meals   then the other  following his example  gathered enough rice for two days at a time  saying   that should be about enough   then another being came to that second one   come on  lets go rice gathering    no need my friend  i   ve gathered enough for two days    the same for four  then eight days   however  when those beings made a store of rice and lived on that  husk powder and husk began to envelop the grain  and where it was reaped it did not grow again  and the cut place showed  and the rice grew in separate clusters     and then those beings came together lamenting   wicked ways have become rife among us  at first we were mind made  feeding on delight    all the events are repeated down to the latest development  each fresh change being said to be due to    wicked and unwholesome ways    and the rice grows in separate clusters  so now let us divide up the rice into fields with boundaries   so they did so     then  vasettha  one greedy natured being  while watching over his own plot  took another plot that was not given to him  and enjoyed the fruits of it  so they seized hold of him and said   you   ve done a wicked thing  taking another   s plot like that  don   t ever do such a thing again    i won   t   he said  but he did the same thing a second and a third time  again  he was seized and rebuked  and some hit him with their fists  some with stones  and some with sticks  and in this way  vasettha  taking what was not given  and censuring  and lying  and punishment took their origin    then those beings came together and lamented the arising of these evil things among them  taking what was not given  censuring  lying  and punishment  and they thought   suppose we were to appoint a certain being who would show anger where anger was due  censure those who deserved it  and banish those who deserved banishment  and in return we would grant him a share of the rice   so they went to the one among them who was the handsomest  the best looking  most pleasant and capable  and asked him to do this for them in return for a share of the rice  and he agreed   the people   s choice  is the meaning of maha sammata      which is the first regular title to be introduced   lord of the fields  is the meaning of khattiya  the second such title  and  he gladdens others with dhamma  is the meaning of raja  the third title to be introduced  this  then  vasettha  is the origin of the class of khattiyas  in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them  they originated among the very same beings  like ourselves  no different and in accordance with dhamma  not otherwise  dhamma is the best thing for people in this life and the next as well     then some beings thought   evil things have appeared among beings  such as taking what is not given  censuring  lying  punishment and banishment  we ought to put aside evil and unwholesome things   and they did so   they put aside evil and unwholesome things  is the meaning of brahmin  which is the first regular title to be introduced for such people  they made leaf huts in forest places and meditated in them  with the smoking fire gone out  with pestle cast aside  gathering alms for their evening and morning meals  they went away to a village  town  or royal city to seek their food  and then they returned to their leaf huts to meditate  people saw this and noted how they meditated   they meditate  is the meaning of jhayaka  which is the second regular title to be introduced     however  some of those beings  not being able to meditate in leaf huts  settled around towns and villages and compiled books  people saw them doing this and not meditating     now  these do not meditate  is the meaning of ajjhayaka  which is the third regular title to be introduced  at that time it was regarded as a low designation  but now it is the higher  this  then  vasettha  is the origin of the class of brahmins in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them  their origin was from among the very same beings  like themselves  not different  and in accordance with dhamma  not otherwise  dhamma is the best thing for people in this life and the next as well     and then  vasettha  some of those beings  having paired off  adopted various trades  and this  various  is the meaning of vessa  which came to be the regular title for such people  this then is the origin of the class of vessas  in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them  their origin was from among these very same beings like themselves  no different  and in accordance with dhamma  not otherwise     and then  vasettha  those beings that remained went in for hunting   they are base who live by the chase   and that is the meaning of sudda  which came to be the regular title for such people  this  then  is the origin of the class of suddas     in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them  their origin was from among these very same beings like themselves  no different  and in accordance with dhamma  not otherwise     and then  vasettha  it came about that some khattiya  dissatisfied with his own dhamma  went forth from the household life into homelessness  thinking   i will become an ascetic   and a brahmin did likewise  a vessa did likewise  and so did a sudda  and from these four classes the class of ascetics came into existence  their origin was from among these very same beings  like themselves  no different  and in accordance with dhamma  not otherwise  dhamma is the best thing for people in this life and the next as well      and  vasettha  a khattiya who has led a bad life in body  speech and thought  and who has wrong view will  in consequence of such wrong views and deeds  at the breaking up of the body after death  be reborn in a state of loss  an ill fate  the downfall  the hell state  so too will a brahmin  a vessa or a sudda     likewise  a khattiya who has led a good life in body  speech  and thought  and who has right view will  in consequence of such right view and deeds  at the breaking up of the body after death  be reborn in a good destiny  in a heaven state  so too will a brahmin  a vessa or a sudda     and a khattiya who has performed deeds of both kinds in body  speech and thought  and whose view is mixed will  in consequence of such mixed views and deeds  at the breaking up of the body after death  experience both pleasure and pain  so too will a brahmin  a vessa  or a sudda     and a khattiya who is restrained in body  speech and thougth  and who has developed the seven requisites of enlightenment  will attain to parinirvana in this very life  so too will a brahmin  a vessa  or a sudda  and  vasettha  whoever of these four castes  as a monk  becomes an arahant who has destroyed the corruptions  done what had to be done  laid down the burden  attained to the highest goal  completely destroyed the fetter of becoming  and become liberated by the highest insight  he is declared to be chief among them in accordance with dhamma  and not otherwise  dhamma   s the best thing for people in this life and the next as well  vasettha  it was brahma sanankumara who spoke this verse  the khattiya   s best among those who value clan  he with knowledge and conduct is best of gods and men  this verse was rightly sung  not wrongly  rightly spoken  not wrongly  connected with profit  not unconnected  i too say  vasettha  the khattiya   s best among those who value clan  he with knowledge and conduct is best of gods and men  thus the lord spoke  and vasettha and bharadvaja were delighted and rejoiced at his words  i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in savatthi  at jeta s grove  anathapindika s park  then the wanderer vacchagotta went to the blessed one and  on arrival  exchanged courteous greetings with him  after an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies  he sat down to one side  as he was sitting there he asked the blessed one   how is it  master gotama  does master gotama hold the view   the cosmos is eternal  only this is true  anything otherwise is worthless        no    then does master gotama hold the view   the cosmos is not eternal  only this is true  anything otherwise is worthless        no    then does master gotama hold the view   the cosmos is finite  only this is true  anything otherwise is worthless        no    then does master gotama hold the view   the cosmos is infinite  only this is true  anything otherwise is worthless        no    then does master gotama hold the view   the soul and the body are the same  only this is true  anything otherwise is worthless        no    then does master gotama hold the view   the soul is one thing and the body another  only this is true  anything otherwise is worthless        no    then does master gotama hold the view   after death a tath  gata exists  only this is true  anything otherwise is worthless        no    then does master gotama hold the view   after death a tath  gata does not exist  only this is true  anything otherwise is worthless        no    then does master gotama hold the view   after death a tath  gata both exists and does not exist  only this is true  anything otherwise is worthless        no    then does master gotama hold the view   after death a tath  gata neither exists nor does not exist  only this is true  anything otherwise is worthless        no     how is it  master gotama  when master gotama is asked if he holds the view  the cosmos is eternal      after death a tath  gata neither exists nor does not exist  only this is true  anything otherwise is worthless   he says     no     in each case  seeing what drawback  then  is master gotama thus entirely dissociated from each of these ten positions    vaccha  the position that  the cosmos is eternal  is a thicket of views  a wilderness of views  a contortion of views  a writhing of views  a fetter of views  it is accompanied by suffering  distress  despair  and fever  and it does not lead to disenchantment  dispassion  cessation  to calm  direct knowledge  full awakening  unbinding   the position that  the cosmos is not eternal            the cosmos is finite            the cosmos is infinite            the soul and the body are the same            the soul is one thing and the body another            after death a tath  gata exists            after death a tath  gata does not exist            after death a tath  gata both exists and does not exist            after death a tath  gata neither exists nor does not exist     does not lead to disenchantment  dispassion  cessation  to calm  direct knowledge  full awakening  unbinding     does master gotama have any position at all    a  position   vaccha  is something that a tath  gata has done away with  what a tath  gata sees is this   such is form  such its origin  such its disappearance  such is feeling  such its origin  such its disappearance  such is perception    such are mental fabrications    such is consciousness  such its origin  such its disappearance   because of this  i say  a tath  gata    with the ending  fading out  cessation  renunciation  and relinquishment of all construings  all excogitations  all i making and mine making and obsession with conceit    is  through lack of clinging sustenance  released    but  master gotama  the monk whose mind is thus released  where does he reappear     reappear   vaccha  doesn t apply    in that case  master gotama  he does not reappear     does not reappear   vaccha  doesn t apply       both does and does not reappear       doesn   t apply       neither does nor does not reappear       doesn   t apply    how is it  master gotama  when master gotama is asked if the monk reappears    does not reappear    both does and does not reappear    neither does nor does not reappear  he says      doesn t apply  in each case  at this point  master gotama  i am befuddled  at this point  confused  the modicum of clarity coming to me from your earlier conversation is now obscured    of course you re befuddled  vaccha  of course you re confused  deep  vaccha  is this phenomenon  hard to see  hard to realize  tranquil  refined  beyond the scope of conjecture  subtle  to be experienced by the wise  for those with other views  other practices  other satisfactions  other aims  other teachers  it is difficult to know  that being the case  i will now put some questions to you  answer as you see fit  how do you construe this  vaccha  if a fire were burning in front of you  would you know that   this fire is burning in front of me        yes      and suppose someone were to ask you  vaccha   this fire burning in front of you  dependent on what is it burning   thus asked  how would you reply       i would reply   this fire burning in front of me is burning dependent on grass and timber as its sustenance     if the fire burning in front of you were to go out  would you know that   this fire burning in front of me has gone out        yes    and suppose someone were to ask you   this fire that has gone out in front of you  in which direction from here has it gone  east  west  north  or south   thus asked  how would you reply    that doesn t apply  master gotama  any fire burning dependent on a sustenance of grass and timber  being unnourished    from having consumed that sustenance and not being offered any other    is classified simply as  out   unbound     even so  vaccha  any physical form by which one describing the tath  gata would describe him  that the tath  gata has abandoned  its root destroyed  like an uprooted palm tree  deprived of the conditions of existence  not destined for future arising  freed from the classification of form  vaccha  the tath  gata is deep  boundless  hard to fathom  like the sea   reappears  doesn t apply   does not reappear  doesn t apply   both does and does not reappear  doesn t apply   neither reappears nor does not reappear  doesn t apply   any feeling    any perception    any mental fabrication     any consciousness by which one describing the tath  gata would describe him  that the tath  gata has abandoned  its root destroyed  like an uprooted palm tree  deprived of the conditions of existence  not destined for future arising  freed from the classification of consciousness  vaccha  the tath  gata is deep  boundless  hard to fathom  like the sea   reappears  doesn t apply   does not reappear  doesn t apply   both does and does not reappear  doesn t apply   neither reappears nor does not reappear  doesn t apply    when this was said  the wanderer vacchagotta said to the blessed one   master gotama  it is as if there were a great sala tree not far from a village or town  from inconstancy  its branches and leaves would wear away  its bark would wear away  its sapwood would wear away  so that on a later occasion    divested of branches  leaves  bark  and sapwood    it would stand as pure heartwood  in the same way  master gotama s words are divested of branches  leaves  bark  and sapwood and stand as pure heartwood   magnificent  master gotama  magnificent  just as if he were to place upright what was overturned  to reveal what was hidden  to show the way to one who was lost  or were to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms  in the same way has master gotama has    through many lines of reasoning    made the dhamma clear  i go to master gotama for refuge  to the dhamma  and to the sangha of monks  may master gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge  from this day forward  for life   i heard thus  at one time the blessed one was living in the monastery offered by anathapindika in jeta   s grove in savatthi  then the wandering ascetic vacchagotta approached the blessed one exchanged friendly greetings  sat on a side and said to the blessed one     good gotama  the world is eternal this only is the truth and all else is false  does good gotama hold this view        no  vaccha  i   m not of that view  the world is eternal  this only is the truth all else is false        good gotama  the world is not eternal  this only is the truth and all else is false does good gotama hold this view        no  vaccha  i   m not of that view  the world is not

with trouble  with burning  not leading to giving up  to detachment  to appeasement  to knowledge  to enlightenment  to cessation and to extinction  the view the world is not eternal   the world is limited  re  the world is not limited    the soul is the body   the soul is different from the body   the thus gone one is  after death   the thus gone one is not  after death   the thus gone one is and is not after death   the thus gone one neither is  nor is not after death is a bond of views  is a speculation in views  it is with unpleasantness  with trouble  with burning  not leading to giving up  to detachment  to appeasement  to knowledge  to enlightenment  to cessation and to extinction  vaccha  seeing these dangers i have thrown out all these views         does good gotama hold any other view        vaccha  the thus gone one has overcome views  this is the view of the thus gone one  this is matter  this is the arising of matter  and this is the fading of matter  this is feeling  this is the arising of feelings and this is the fading of feelings  this is perception  this is the arising of perceptions and this is the fading of perceptions  these are determinations  this is the arising of determinations and this  the fading of determinations  this is consciousness  this is the arising of consciousness and this is fading of consciousness  therefore  i say the thus gone one has destroyed  is detached  has given up and is released  from all imaginings  recollections  and all latent tendencies of me and mine        good gotama  where is the thus released mind born        vaccha  is born does not apply       then good gotama  is he not born        vaccha  is not born does not apply        gotama  is he born and not born        vaccha  is born and is not born does not apply        then gotama  is he neither born  nor not born        vaccha  is neither born  nor is not born  is non applicable          when asked where is the thus released mind born  it was said  is born does not apply  when asked is it not born  it was said not born does not apply  when asked is it born and not born  it was said  born and not born does not apply  when asked  is it neither born  nor is not born  it was said neither born nor not born  does not apply  good gotama  in this i am completely ignorant and deluded  whatever little understanding i had with the earlier conversation  has now vanished        vaccha  your ignorance and delusion is nothing strange  this is deep  difficult to understand peaceful and exalted  not for logical thinking  is clever and should be experienced by the wise  by one of another sect like you  with some other liking  without being yoked in it and living in it  it cannot be understood  so then vaccha  i will question you  on this and you may reply as it pleases you  there is a fire burning in front of you  would you know  there is a fire burning in front of me        good gotama  if a fire burns in front of me  i would know  there   s a fire burning in front of me        vaccha  if you were asked  this fire burning in front of you  on account of what is it burning  how would you reply        good gotama  if i was asked  this fire burning in front of you  on account of what is it burning  i would reply  this fire burning in front of me is burning on account of grass and sticks        vaccha  if the fire in front of you extinguishes  would you know  this fire in front of me has extinguished        good gotama  if the fire in front of me extinguishes  i would know  this fire has extinguished       vaccha  if you were asked  this fire that has extinguished in which direction did it go  to the east  west  north or south        good  gotama  it does not apply  that fire burnt on account of grass and sticks  those supports finished  no other supports were supplied  without supports the fire  went out        vaccha  in that same manner  the matter with which the thus gone one is pointed out  is dispelled  uprooted  made a palm stump  made a thing not to grow again  vaccha  the thus gone one is released from the reckonings of matter  it is deep  difficult to fathom  like the great ocean  is born  does not apply  is not born does not apply  is born and is not born does not apply  neither is born  nor is not born does not apply  the feelings  with which the thus gone one is pointed  are dispelled  uprooted  made palm stumps made things not to grow again  vaccha  the thus gone one is released from the reckonings of feelings  it is deep  difficult to fathom  like the great ocean  is born does not apply  is not born does not apply  is born and is not born does not apply  neither is born nor is not born does not apply  the perceptions  with which the thus gone one is pointed  are dispelled

not apply  is not born does not apply  is born and is not born does not apply  neither is born nor is not born does not apply  the determinations with which the thus gone one is pointed out  are dispelled  uprooted  made palm stumps  made things not to grow again  vaccha  the thus gone one is released from the reckonings of determinations  it is deep  difficult to fathom like the great ocean

ocean  is born does not apply  is not born does not apply  is born and is not born does not apply  neither is born nor is not born does not apply     when this was said the wandering ascetic vacchagotta said thus to the blessed one  close to the village or hamlet  there is a huge sala tree  because of impermanence  its leaves  branches  bark  shoots and sapwood fall off and is left with only the heartwood  in the same manner  on account of the words of good gotama  with my leaves and branches pulled out  shoots pulled out  the bark removed  the sap removed  i stand as the pure heartwood  i understand good gotama  it is as though something over turned is reinstalled  something covered is made manifest  as though the path is shown to someone who had lost his way  as though an oil lamp is lighted  for those who have sight to see forms in the dark  now  i take refuge in good gotama  in the teaching  in the community of bhikkhus  may the blessed one bear me as a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today until life lasts   there are these ten ways of subduing hatred  which ten       thinking   he has done me harm  but what should i expect   one subdues hatred       thinking   he is doing me harm  but what should i expect   one subdues hatred       thinking   he is going to do me harm  but what should i expect   one subdues hatred       thinking   he has done harm to people who are dear   pleasing to me  but what should i expect   one subdues hatred       thinking   he is doing harm to people who are dear   pleasing to me  but what should i expect   one subdues hatred       thinking   he is going to do harm to people who are dear   pleasing to me  but what should i expect   one subdues hatred       thinking   he has aided people who are not dear or pleasing to me  but what should i expect   one subdues hatred       thinking   he is aiding people who are not dear or pleasing to me  but what should i expect   one subdues hatred       thinking   he is going to aid people who are not dear or pleasing to me  but what should i expect   one subdues hatred        one does not get worked up over impossibilities   these are ten ways of subduing hatred    bhikkhus  there are these five ways of removing annoyance  by which annoyance can be entirely removed by a bhikkhu when it arises in him  what are the five   loving kindness can be maintained in being towards a person with whom you are annoyed  this is how annoyance with him can be removed   compassion can be maintained in being towards a person with whom you are annoyed  this too is how annoyance with him can be removed   onlooking equanimity can be maintained in being towards a person with whom you are annoyed  this too is how annoyance with him can be removed the forgetting and ignoring of a person with whom you are annoyed can be practiced  this too is how annoyance with him can be removed  removing annoyance      ownership of deeds in a person with whom you are annoyed can be concentrated upon thus   this good person is owner of his deeds  heir to his deeds  his deeds are the womb from which he is born  his deeds are his kin for whom he is responsible  his deeds are his refuge  he is heir to his deeds  be they good or bad   this too is how annoyance with him can be removed   these are the five ways of removing annoyance  by which annoyance can be entirely removed in a bhikkhu when it arises in him    these are five ways of subduing hatred by which  when hatred arises in a monk  he should wipe it out completely  which five   when one gives birth to hatred for an individual  one should develop good will for that individual  thus the hatred for that individual should be subdued   when one gives birth to hatred for an individual  one should develop compassion for that individual    equanimity toward that individual    one should pay him no mind and pay him no attention    when one gives birth to hatred for an individual  one should direct one s thoughts to the fact of his being the product of his kamma   this venerable one is the doer of his kamma  heir of his kamma  born of his kamma  related by his kamma  and is dependent on his kamma  whatever kamma he does  for good or for evil  to that will he fall heir   thus the hatred for that individual should be subdued   these are five ways of subduing hatred by which  when hatred arises in a monk  he should wipe it out completely    endowed with three characteristics  a king s excellent thoroughbred steed is worthy of a king  the wealth of a king  and counts as one of the king s own limbs  which three  there is the case where a king s excellent thoroughbred steed is consummate in beauty  consummate in strength  and consummate in speed  endowed with these three characteristics is a king s excellent thoroughbred steed worthy of a king  the wealth of a king  and counts as one of the king s own limbs   in the same way  a monk endowed with these three qualities is worthy of gifts  worthy of hospitality  worthy of offerings  worthy of respect  an unexcelled field of merit for the world  which three  there is the case where a monk is consummate in beauty  consummate in strength  and consummate in speed   and how is a monk consummate in beauty  there is the case where a monk is virtuous  he dwells restrained in accordance with the patimokkha  consummate in his behavior   sphere of activity  he trains himself  having undertaken the training rules  seeing danger in the slightest fault  this is how a monk is consummate in beauty   and how is a monk consummate in strength  there is the case where a monk keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on skillful mental qualities  he is steadfast  solid in his effort  not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualities  this is how a monk is consummate in strength   and how is a monk consummate in speed  there is the case where a monk discerns as it actually is present that  this is stress   he discerns as it actually is present that  this is the origination of stress   he discerns as it actually is present that  this is the cessation of stress   he discerns as it actually is present that  this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress   this is how a monk is consummate in speed   endowed with these three qualities is a monk worthy of gifts  worthy of hospitality  worthy of offerings  worthy of respect  an unexcelled field of merit for the world   thus have i heard  on one occasion ven  ananda was staying in kosambi at ghosita s monastery  then a certain householder  a disciple of the fatalists  ajivakas   went to him and  on arrival  having bowed down to him  sat to one side  as he was sitting there he said to ven  ananda   among us  sir  whose dhamma is well taught  who has practiced well in this world  who in the world is well gone    in that case  householder  i will question you in return  answer as you see fit  now  what do you think  those who teach a dhamma for the abandoning of passion  for the abandoning of aversion  for the abandoning of delusion    is their dhamma well taught or not  or how does this strike you    sir  those who teach a dhamma for the abandoning of passion  for the abandoning of aversion  for the abandoning of delusion    their dhamma is well taught  that s how it strikes me    and what do you think  householder  those who have practiced for the abandoning of passion  for the abandoning of aversion  for the abandoning of delusion    have they practiced well in this world or not  or how does this strike you    sir  those who have practiced for the abandoning of passion  for the abandoning of aversion  for the abandoning of delusion    they have practiced well in this world  that s how it strikes me    and what do you think  householder  those whose passion is abandoned  its root destroyed  like an uprooted palm tree  deprived of the conditions of existence  not destined for future arising  those whose aversion is abandoned     whose delusion is abandoned  its root destroyed  like an uprooted palm tree  deprived of the conditions of existence  not destined for future arising  are they  in this world  well gone or not  or how does this strike you    sir  those whose passion     aversion     delusion is abandoned  its root destroyed  like an uprooted palm tree  deprived of the conditions of existence  not destined for future arising  they  in this world  are well gone  that s how it strikes me    in this way  householder  you have answered yourself   those who teach a dhamma for the abandoning of passion  for the abandoning of aversion  for the abandoning of delusion    their dhamma is well taught  those who have practiced for the abandoning of passion  for the abandoning of aversion  for the abandoning of delusion    they have practiced well in this world  those whose passion     aversion     delusion is abandoned  its root destroyed  like an uprooted palm tree  deprived of the conditions of existence  not destined for future arising  they  in this world  are well gone     how amazing  sir  how astounding  that there is neither extolling of one s own dhamma nor deprecation of another s  but just the teaching of the dhamma in its proper sphere  speaking to the point without mentioning oneself   you  venerable sir  teach the dhamma for the abandoning of passion     aversion     delusion  your dhamma is well taught  you have practiced for the abandoning of passion     aversion     delusion  you have practiced well in this world  your passion     aversion     delusion is abandoned  its root destroyed  like an uprooted palm tree  deprived of the conditions of existence  not destined for future arising  you  in this world  are well gone   magnificent  master ananda  magnificent  in many ways has master ananda made the dhamma clear    just as if he were to place upright what has been overturned  to reveal what has been hidden  to point out the way to one who is lost  or to set out a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes might see forms  i go to the buddha for refuge  to the dhamma    to the community of monks  may master ananda remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward  for life   on one occasion the blessed one was staying near savatthi in jeta s grove  anathapindika s monastery  there he addressed the monks   monks    yes  lord   the monks responded  the blessed one said   monks  dwell consummate in virtue  consummate in terms of the patimokkha  dwell restrained in accordance with the patimokkha  consummate in your behavior and sphere of activity  train yourselves  having undertaken the training rules  seeing danger in the slightest faults       if a monk would wish   may i be dear and pleasing to my fellows in the holy life  respected by and inspiring to them   then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection  who is committed to mental calm  who does not neglect jhana  who is endowed with insight  and who frequents empty dwellings       if a monk would wish   may i be someone who receives robes  alms food  lodgings  and medical requisites for curing the sick   then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection  who is committed to mental calm  who does not neglect jhana  who is endowed with insight  and who frequents empty dwellings       if a monk would wish   whatever i use or consume in terms of robes  alms food  lodgings  and medical requisites for curing the sick  may that be of great fruit  of great benefit to those who provided them   then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection  who is committed to mental calm  who does not neglect jhana  who is endowed with insight  and who frequents empty dwellings       if a monk would wish   may it also be of great fruit  of great benefit  to whatever dead relatives they  the donors  recollect with brightened minds   then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection  who is committed to mental calm  who does not neglect jhana  who is endowed with insight  and who frequents empty dwellings       if a monk would wish   may i be content with whatever robes  alms food  lodgings  and medical requisites for curing the sick are available   then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection  who is committed to mental calm  who does not neglect jhana  who is endowed with insight  and who frequents empty dwellings       if a monk would wish   may i be resistant to cold  heat  hunger  and thirst  to the touch of gadflies and mosquitoes  wind and sun and creeping things  to abusive  hurtful language  to bodily feelings that  when they arise  are painful  sharp  stabbing  fierce  distasteful  deadly   then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection  who is committed to mental calm  who does not neglect jhana  who is endowed with insight  and who frequents empty dwellings       if a monk would wish   may i overcome displeasure  and not be overcome by displeasure  may i dwell having conquered any displeasure that has arisen   then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection  who is committed to mental calm  who does not neglect jhana  who is endowed with insight  and who frequents empty dwellings       if a monk would wish   may i overcome fear and dread  and not be overcome by fear and dread  may i dwell having conquered any fear and dread that have arisen   then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection  who is committed to mental calm  who does not neglect jhana  who is endowed with insight  and who frequents empty dwellings       if a monk would wish   may i attain    whenever i want  without strain  without difficulty    the four jhanas that are heightened mental states  pleasant abiding in the here and now   then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection  who is committed to mental calm  who does not neglect jhana  who is endowed with insight  and who frequents empty dwellings        if a monk would wish   may i    with the ending of mental fermentations    remain in the fermentation free release of awareness and release of discernment  having directly known and realized them for myself in the here and now   then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection  who is committed to mental calm  who does not neglect jhana  who is endowed with insight  and who frequents empty dwellings    monks  dwell consummate in virtue  consummate in terms of the patimokkha  dwell restrained in accordance with the patimokkha  consummate in your behavior and sphere of activity  train yourselves  having undertaken the training rules  seeing danger in the slightest faults   thus was it said and in reference to this was it said   thus have i heard  on one occasion the blessed one was living at savatthi in jeta   s grove  there he addressed the monks   monks  live lives filled with virtue  model your behavior upon the patimokkha  monastic code of discipline   and you will be perfect in conduct and filled with fear at the slightest fault  therefore  train your mind by following the  monastic  precepts  if a monk should wish     may i be loved and befriended by my companions in the holy life  may i be respected and honored by them     if this is so  let him live by the precepts  achieve serenity of mind  practice daily to develop insight and dwell in seclusion   this is the law by which he should live  if a monk should wish     may i acquire sufficient robes  alms food  a clean  decent resting place  and even medical supplies when necessary     let him live by the law  if a monk should wish     may the services of those who grant to me robes  alms food  a resting place and even medicinal supplies bring to them great merit and benefit    then let him live by this law  if a monk should wish     may my family  those that have died  profit from my behavior  may those of my family who still live  model themselves on my behavior  thereby earning vast merit and experiencing great benefit     then let him live by this law  if a monk should wish     may i conquer unhappiness as well as delight  and may these emotions not conquer me     let him live by this law  if a monk should wish     may i defeat fear and dismay  and may not fear and dismay conquer me     let him live by this law  if a monk should wish     may i obtain the four mental absorptions that make up the higher mind without great difficulty  so that i might dwell peacefully in the now     let him live by this law     if a monk should wish     may i attain those liberations that bring peace and lose all desire for material objects     let him live by this law  if a monk should wish     may i destroy the three chains    the view of self     doubts     sensual desire and ill will  that bind me to suffering and become a stream enterer     let him live by this law  if a monk should wish     may i  having destroyed these three chains and other mental impurities  attain to the stage of once returner     let him live by this law  if a monk should wish     may i attain re birth in the pure land and there attain final nirvana     let him live by this law  if a monk should wish     may i exercise all super normal powers to aid my teaching of other beings     let him live by this law  if a monk should wish     may i develop the purified ear that allows me to hear both human and divine sounds     let him live by this law  if a monk should wish     may i comprehend the minds of all the beings i encounter  may i recognize those whose minds are pure as well as impure     let him live by this law  if a monk should wish     may i recall my numberless past lives     let him live by this law  if a monk should wish     may i develop the pure eye that allows me to see and understand how beings are born and pass on according to their actions     let him live by this law  if a monk should wish     may i  in this present moment  enter and abide in the freedom that comes from the destruction of all impurities     let him live by this law  that is what the blessed one said and the monks were satisfied and took

then the brahmin akkosaka   insulter   bharadvaja heard that a brahmin of the bharadvaja clan had gone forth from the home life into homelessness in the presence of the blessed one  angered and displeased  he went to the blessed one and  on arrival  insulted and cursed him with rude  harsh words  when this was said  the blessed one said to him   what do you think  brahmin  do friends and colleagues  relatives and kinsmen come to you as guests     yes  master gautama  sometimes friends and colleagues  relatives and kinsmen come to me as guests     and what do you think  do you serve them with staple and non staple foods and delicacies     yes  sometimes i serve them with staple and non staple foods and delicacies     and if they don t accept them  to whom do those foods belong     if they don t accept them  master gautama  those foods are all mine     in the same way  brahmin  that with which you have insulted me  who is not insulting  that with which you have taunted me  who is not taunting  that with which you have berated me  who is not berating  that i don t accept from you  it s all yours  brahmin  it s all yours    whoever returns insult to one who is insulting  returns taunts to one who is taunting  returns a berating to one who is berating  is said to be eating together  sharing company  with that person  but i am neither eating together nor sharing your company  brahmin  it s all yours  it s all yours     the king together with his court know this of master gautama     gautama the contemplative is an arhat     and yet still master gautama gets angry   whence is there anger   for one free from anger      tamed      living in tune      one released through right knowing    calmed     and such  you make things worse   when you flare up   at someone who s angry    whoever doesn t flare up   at someone who s angry   wins a battle     hard to win  you live for the good of both             your own  the other s      when  knowing the other s provoked    you mindfully grow calm  when you work the cure of both             your own  the other s      those who think you a fool   know nothing of dhamma    when this was said  the brahmin akkosaka bharadvaja said to the blessed one   magnificent  master gautama  magnificent  just as if he were to place upright what had been overturned  were to reveal what was hidden  were to show the way to one who was lost  or were to hold up a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms  in the same way master gautama has    through many lines of reasoning    made the dhamma clear  i go to the blessed one for refuge  to the dhamma  and to the community of monks  let me obtain the going forth in master gautama   s presence  let me obtain admission    then the brahmin akkosaka bharadvaja received the going forth and the admission in the blessed one s presence  and not long after his admission    dwelling alone  secluded  heedful  ardent  and resolute    he in no long time reached and remained in the supreme goal of the holy life  for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness  knowing and realizing it for himself in the here and now  he knew   birth is ended  the holy life fulfilled  the task done  there is nothing further for the sake of this world   and so ven  bharadvaja became another one of the arhats   thus i heard  at one time the blessed one was living in the monastery offered by anathapindika in jeta   s grove in savatthi  at that time to a bhikkhu named arittha  a vulture trainer in his previous birth  this evil view had arisen  as i know the teaching of the blessed one  to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments  then many bhikkhus heard that this evil view had arisen to the bhikkhu arittha  a vulture trainer in his previous birth as i know the teaching of the blessed one  to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments  then they approached the bhikkhu arittha and asked him  friend arittha is it true that such an evil view has arisen to you  as i know the teaching of the blessed one  to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments  yes  friends  as i know the teaching of the blessed one  to one who pursues those impedimental things declared  as impediments are not suitable impediments  then those bhikkhus thinking to dissuade the bhikkhu arittha from that evil view  cross questioned him  asked for reasons and discussed with him  friend  arittha do not say that  do not accuse the blessed one  the blessed one did not say that  the blessed one has shown in various ways how these impedimental things are impediments to one who pursues them  the blessed one has said that sensuality brings little satisfaction much unpleasantness and much trouble  there are many dangers there  the blessed one has said that sensuality is comparable to a skeleton  a tendon of flesh  a burning grass torch  a pit full of burning charcoal  a dream  something borrowed  like a tree full of fruits  a slaughter house  the blade of a weapon  the head of a serpent  the blessed one has said that sensuality brings much unpleasantness  much trouble and many dangers  even when so much was told the bhikkhu arittha held on tenaciously to his view and would not give it up  as i know the teaching of the blessed one  to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments when the bhikkhus could not dissuade the bhikkhu arittha from that evil view  they approached the blessed one  worshipped  sat on a side and said thus  venerable sir  to a bhikkhu named arittha  a vulture trainer in his previous birth  this evil view had arisen  as i know the teaching of the blessed one  to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments  then many of us heard that this evil view had arisen to the bhikkhu arittha  a vulture trainer in his previous birth as i know the teaching of the blessed one  to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments  then we approached the bhikkhu arittha and asked him   friend arittha is it true that such an evil view has arisen to you  as i know the teaching of the blessed one  to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments  he said  yes  friends  as i know the teaching of the blessed one  to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments  then we bhikkhus thinking to dissuade the bhikkhu arittha from that evil view  cross questioned him  asked for reasons and discussed with him  friend  arittha do not say that  do not accuse the blessed one  the blessed one did not say that  the blessed one has shown in various ways how these impedimental things are impediments to one who pursues them  the blessed one has said that sensuality brings little satisfaction much unpleasantness and much trouble  there are many dangers there  the blessed one has said that sensuality is comparable to a skeleton  a tendon of flesh  a burning grass torch  a pitfull of burning charcoal  a dream  something borrowed  like a tree full of fruits  a slaughter house  the blade of a weapon  the head of a serpent  the blessed one has said that sensuality brings much unpleasantness  much trouble and many dangers  even when so much was told the bhikkhu arittha held on tenaciously to his view and would not give it up  as i know the teaching of the blessed one  to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments are not suitable impediments as we could not dissuade the bhikkhu arittha from that evil view  we came to inform you about it  then the blessed one addressed a certain bhikkhu and said  come bhikkhu  in my words call the bhikkhu arittha  tell  the teacher wants him  that bhikkhu consenting approached the bhikkhu arittha and told him  friend  the teacher wants you   the bhikkhu arittha saying yes  friend  approached the blessed one  worshipped and sat on a side  then the blessed one said  arittha  is it true  that such a view has arisen to you  as i know the teaching of the blessed one  to one who pursues those impedimental things declared as impediments  are not suitable impediments  then he said  yes  venerable sir  as i know the teaching of the blessed one  to one who pursues those impedimental things  declared as impediments  are not suitable impediments   foolish man  to whom do you know me teaching this  haven   t i in many ways told that the impedimental things are impediments  indeed to one who pursues them they are impediments  i have told that sensuality brings little satisfaction  much un pleasantness and trouble  the dangers here are many    i have told that sensuality is comparable to a skeleton  a tendon of flesh  a burning grass torch  a pit of burning charcoal  a dream  something borrowed  a tree full of fruits  the blade of a weapon  the head of a serpent  i have told it has much unpleasantness  much trouble and the dangers there are many  yet you foolish man  on account of your wrong view you accuse me and destroy yourself and accumulate much demerit  which will be for your unpleasantness for a long time  then the blessed one addressed  bhikkhus  what do you think  shouldn   t we chastise this bhikkhu arittha  a vulture trainer in his earlier birth from this dispensation when this was said the bhikkhu arittha a vulture trainer in his earlier birth became silent  and unable to reply back  with a drooping form sat with eyes turned down  then the blessed one knowing that the bhikkhu arittha a vulture trainer in his earlier birth has become silent  unable to reply back  with a drooping form sitting with eyes turned down told him  foolish man  you will be pointed out on account of this evil view  now i will question the bhikkhus on this then the blessed one addressed the bhikkhus  bhikkhus  do you too know of this teaching  the wrong view of the bhikkhu arittha  a vulture trainer in his earlier birth on account of which he brings blame on us and also destroys himself and accumulates much unpleasantness   no venerable sir  the impedimental things are told by the blessed one and indeed to one who pursues them  they are impediments  the blessed one has said that there is little satisfaction in sensuality  much unpleasantness and much trouble  the dangers there are many  the blessed one has said that sensuality is comparable to a skeleton  a tendon of flesh  a burning grass torch  a pit of burning charcoal  a dream  something borrowed  a tree full of fruits  the blade of a weapon  and the head of a serpent  the blessed on has said it has much unpleasantness  much trouble and the dangers there are many   good  bhikkhus  good  that you know the teaching taught by me  in various ways i have shown the impedimental things and indeed it is impedimental to pursues them  i have told that sensuality brings little satisfaction  much unpleasantness and the dangers there are many  i have told it is comparable to skeleton  to the head of a serpent brings little satisfaction  much unpleasantness and the dangers there are many  yet the bhikkhu arittha holding to this wrong view blames us and destroys himself and accumulates much demerit  and it will be for his unpleasantness for a long time  bhikkhus  someone could indulge in sensuality  without sensual perceptions  without sensual thoughts is not possible bhikkhus  a certain foolish man learns the prose sections  prose and verse sections  the answers and explanation expositions  stanzas  solemn utterances  thus said

teaching  like a man wandering in search of a serpent would come to a huge serpent  he would take hold of the serpent by the hood or the tail and it would turn round and sting the hand or foot or any

listen to it carefully  like a man come to the highway would see a large stretch of water  the hither shore dangerous and fearful  the thither shore peaceful and without fear  there is no ship or overhead bridge to cross over from the hither shore to the thither  what if i build a raft collecting grass  sticks  branches and creepers  so he built a raft collecting grass sticks branches and creepers  and making effort with hands and feet reached the other shore safely  then to the one who has crossed over this thought occurred this raft was of great service to me  i safely crossed over to the other shore boarding it and putting forth effort with my hands and feet  what if i balance it on my head or haul it on my back and go where i like  bhikkhus  is he doing the right thing if he does so with the raft   doing what will he be doing the right thing with the raft   bhikkhus  to the man who has crossed over it occurs thus  this raft was of great service to me  i safely crossed over to the other shore boarding it and putting forth effort with my hands and feet  what if i pulled it up to dry ground   or sink it in the water and go where i like  a man doing that would be doing the right thing  just so  bhikkhus  my teaching is comparable to a raft for the purpose of crossing over and not for getting hold of  you should give up even the teaching that should be known  and what about that which should not be known    bhikkhus  these six are the views  what six  bhikkhus  the ordinary man who has not seen the noble ones and great beings  not clever in their teaching  and not trained in their teaching sees matter  that is me  i am that  that is my self  sees feelings   that is me  i am that  that is my self  sees determinations  that is me  i am that  that is my self  whatever seen  heard  tasted  smelt and bodily felt  cognized  attained  sought after  and reflected in the mind  that is me  i am that  that is my self the world  the self  i will be in the future  permanent  not changing  an eternal thing   that is me  i am that  that is my self  bhikkhus  the learned noble disciple  who has seen noble ones and great beings  clever in their teaching  and trained in their teaching sees matter  that is not me  am not that  that is not my self  sees feelings  that is not me  am not that  that is not my self  sees determinations  that is not me am not that  that is not my self  whatever seen  heard  tasted  smelt  bodily felt  cognized  attained  sought after  and reflected in the mind  that is not me  am not that  that is not my self  the world  the self  i will be in the future  permanent  not changing  an eternal thing  that is not me  am not that  that is not my self   seeing it is not present  is not excited    when this was said  a certain bhikkhu said to the blessed one  venerable sir  is there excitement for external non presence  the blessed one said  there is bhikkhu  here  bhikkhu  it occurs to someone thus  there was to me  now it is not to me  i had  now i do not gain  he grieves  laments and beats the breast and comes to bewilderment of mind  thus there is excitement for external non presence    venerable sir  is there non excitement for external non presence  the blessed one said  there is bhikkhu  here  bhikkhu  it does not occur to someone  there was to me  now it is not to me  i had  now i do not gain  he does not grieve or lament  does not beat the breast and come to bewilderment of mind  thus there is no excitement for external non presence   venerable sir  is there excitement for internal non presence  the blessed one said  there is bhikkhu  here  bhikkhu  to a certain one there is this view  the world  the self  i will be in the future  permanent  not changing  an eternal thing  then he hears this teaching from the thus gone one or from a disciple of the thus gone one for the complete abolishment of views  determinant resolutions  prepossessions  latent tendencies for settlements  for the appeasement of all determinations  for the giving up of all endearments  for the destruction of craving  for non attachment  cessation and extinction  then it occurs to him  indeed it will be my annihilation  my destruction  i will not be  he grieves  laments  beats the breast and comes to bewilderment of mind  thus  there is excitement for internal non presence  venerable sir  is there non excitement for internal non presence  there is bhikkhu  said the blessed one  here bhikkhu  to a certain one there is not this view  this world  this self  i will be in the future  permanent  not changing  an eternal thing  then he hears this teaching from the thus gone one or from a disciple of the thus gone one for the complete abolishment of views  determinant resolutions  prepossessions  latent tendencies for settlements  for the appeasement of all determinations  for the giving up of all endearments  for the destruction of craving  for non attachment  cessation and extinction  then it does not occur to him  indeed it will be my annihilation  my destruction  i will not be  he does not grieve  lament  beat the breast and come to bewilderment of mind  thus  there is non excitement for internal non presence  thus there is non excitement for internal non presence  bhikkhus  do you see anything permanent  not changing  eternal  to seize  no  venerable sir  good  i too do not see anything to seize that which is permanent  not changing  and stands eternity  bhikkhus  is there the holding of a self view which does not give birth to grief  lament  unpleasantness  displeasure and distress  no  venerable sir  good  i too do not see a self view which does not give birth to grief  lament  unpleasantness  displeasure and distress  bhikkhus is there a settled view which does not give birth to grief  lament  unpleasantness  displeasure and distress  no  venerable sir  good  i too do not see a settled view which does not give birth to grief  lament  unpleasantness  displeasure and distress  bhikkhus  when there are belongings of a self  is there a satisfaction  these are mine  yes  venerable sir   a self or the belongings of a self  in reality and truth cannot be gained  bhikkhus  this settled view  about the world  and the self  i will be in the future  permanent  not changing  standing eternity  isn   t it a completely foolish notion  why isn   t it  venerable sir  it is a completely foolish notion  what do you think    is matter permanent or impermanent    impermanent  venerable sir    that which is impermanent  is it unpleasant or pleasant     unpleasant venerable sir    that which is impermanent  unpleasant  a changing thing is it good to be considered that is me  that i am that is my self     no  venerable sir    is feeling permanent or impermanent    impermanent  venerable sir    that which is impermanent  is it unpleasant or pleasant     unpleasant venerable sir    that which is impermanent  unpleasant  a changing thing is it good to be considered that is me  that i am  that is my self    no  venerable sir   are perceptions permanent or impermanent    impermanent  venerable sir    that which is impermanent  is it unpleasant or pleasant     unpleasant venerable sir    that which is impermanent  unpleasant  a changing thing is it good to be considered that is me  that i am  that is my self    no  venerable sir    are determinations permanent or impermanent    impermanent  venerable sir    that which is impermanent  is it unpleasant or pleasant     unpleasant venerable sir    that which is impermanent  unpleasant  a changing thing is it good to be considered that is me  that i am  that is my self    no  venerable sir    is consciousness permanent or impermanent    impermanent  venerable sir    that which is impermanent  is it unpleasant or pleasant     unpleasant venerable sir    that which is impermanent  unpleasant  a changing thing is it good to be considered that is me  that i am  that is my self    no  venerable sir     therefore bhikkhus  whatever matter  in the past  future or present  internal or external  exalted or un exalted  far or near  all matter is not me  that am not  that is not my self  should be realized as it really is  with right wisdom  whatever feelings   whatever perceptions    whatever determinations  whatever consciousness  in the past  future or present  internal or external  exalted or un exalted  far or near  all consciousness is not me  that am not  that is not my self  should be realized as it really is  with right wisdom  the learned noble disciple seeing thus detaches from matter  detaches from feelings  detaches from perceptions  detaches from determinations  detaches from consciousness  detached is released  released knowledge arises am released  birth destroyed  the holy life lived to the end  what should be done is done  there is nothing more to wish for  he knows  to this is called removing the obstacle  filling the trenches  pulling out desires  seeing results  the noble one puts down the flag and is unyoked bhikkhus  how does the bhikkhu remove the obstacle  here the bhikkhus ignorance is dispelled  pulled out from the roots  and made a palm stump of it  so that it may not rise again  thus the obstacle is removed  how does the bhikkhu fill up the trenches  here the bhikkhu dispels the recurring births  making a palm stump of it so that it may not rise again  thus the bhikkhu fills up the trenches  how does the bhikkhu pull out desires  here the bhikkhu dispels greed  together with the roots  makes it a palm stump  so that it may not rise again  thus the bhikkhu pulls out desires  how does the bhikkhu see results  here the bhikkhu dispels the bonds to the sensual world  cuts them up completely  so that they may not rise again  thus the bhikkhu sees results  how does the noble one put down the flag and unyoke  here the bhikkhu dispels the conceit    i be    pulling it out from the roots makes a palm stump of it  so that it may not rise again  thus the bhikkhu puts down the flag and unyokes  bhikkhus  if that released mind of the bhikkhu was to be searched by inda  brahma  pajapati and their retinue  it would not be found  thus unsupported is the consciousness of the thus gone one  what is the reason  i say that the thus gone one cannot be found even here and now  to me who says thus and preaches thus  certain recluses and brahmins ingenuinely  untruthfully blame  the recluse gotama the discipliner  purposefully shows the annihilation  destruction  and non evidence of beings  bhikkhus  whatever i am not  that i do not proclaim  as a result these good recluses and brahmins ingenuinely  untruthfully blame  the recluse gotama the discipliner purposefully shows the annihilation  destruction and non evidence of beings  earlier and now also i declare  unpleasant and its cessation  others abuse  blame and annoy the thus gone one  for that the thus gone one has no ill feeling   aversion or discontent  some others honor  revere and worship the thus gone one  for that the thus gone one has no blissful pleasurable joy  when others honor  revere and worship the thus gone one  it occurs to him  it is on account of what i have thoroughly understood that they do it  bhikkhus  when others abuse  blame and annoy you  ill feeling  aversion and discontent should not be to you  again bhikkhus  when others honor  revere and worship you  a blissful pleasurable joy should not be to you  it should occur to you  it is on account of what i have thoroughly understood  that they do it   therefore bhikkhus  if people carry away  burn or do what they like to grass sticks branches creepers in this same jeta   s grove  would it occur to you  people are carrying away  burning and doing what they like to us   no  venerable sir   what is the reason  venerable sir  they are not our selves or the belongings of ourselves     bhikkhus  in the same manner  whatever is not yours  dispel it   for your good welfare and pleasantness for a long time  bhikkhus  what is not yours  matter is not yours  dispel it for your good  welfare and pleasantness for a long time  feeling is not yours  dispel it for your good  welfare and pleasantness for a long time  perception is not yours  dispel it for your good  welfare and pleasantness for a long time  determinations are not yours  dispel it for your good  welfare and pleasantness for a long time  consciousness is not yours  dispel it for your good welfare and pleasantness for a long time  bhikkhus  my teaching is well proclaimed  made manifest  open and threadbare those bhikkhus  who have perfected  destroyed desires  lived the holy life  done what should be done  put down the weight  attained to the highest good  destroyed the bonds of being  and released rightfully knowing   they have no further proceeding to show them  my teaching is so well proclaimed  made manifest  open and threadbare those bhikkhus who have dispelled the five lower fetters  they all arise spontaneously  and extinguish there itself  do not proceed from that world  my teaching is so well proclaimed  made manifest  open and threadbare  those bhikkhus  who have dispelled the three fetters and diminishing greed  hate and delusion  they all become once returners  coming only once more to this world  to make an end of un pleasantness  my teaching is so well proclaimed  made manifest  open and threadbare  those bhikkhus who have dispelled the three fetters  all of them enter the stream of the teaching  do not fall from there intending only extinction  my teaching is so well proclaimed  made manifest  open and threadbare  those who have some faith in me  some love for me they all are intent on heaven  the blessed one said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the blessed one  i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at alavi in the haunt of the alavaka yakkha  then the alavaka yakkha went to the blessed one and on arrival said to him   get out  contemplative    saying    all right  my friend   the blessed one went out    come in  contemplative    saying    all right  my friend   the blessed one went in   a second time    a third time  the alavaka yakkha said to the blessed one   get out  contemplative    saying    all right  my friend   the blessed one went out   come in  contemplative    saying    all right  my friend   the blessed one went in  then a fourth time  the alavaka yakkha said to the blessed one   get out  contemplative    i won t go out  my friend  do what you have to do    i will ask you a question  contemplative  if you can t answer me  i will possess your mind or rip open your heart or  grabbing you by the feet  hurl you across the ganges    my friend  i see no one in the cosmos with its devas  maras   brahmas  its contemplatives   priests  its royalty   commonfolk  who could possess my mind or rip open my heart or  grabbing me by the feet  hurl me across the ganges  but nevertheless  ask me what you wish    what is a person s highest wealth     what  when well practiced  brings bliss    what is the highest of savors     living in what way    is one s life called the best  conviction is a person s highest wealth    dhamma  when well practiced  brings bliss    truth is the highest of savors    living with discernment     one s life is called best  how does one cross over the flood     how cross over the sea     how does one overcome suffering   stress     how                is a person purified  through conviction one crosses over the flood    through heedfulness  the sea     through persistence one overcomes     suffering   stress     through discernment  a person is purified  how does one gain discernment     how does one find wealth     how does one attain honor     how bind friends to oneself      passing from this world    to    the next world     how  does one not grieve  convinced of the arahants  dhamma   for attaining unbinding       heedful  observant      one listening well     gains discernment     doing what s fitting     enduring burdens     one with initiative    finds wealth     through truth     one attains honor     giving     binds friends to oneself  endowed with these four qualities     truth     self control     stamina     relinquishment      a householder of conviction    on passing away  doesn t grieve   now  go ask others     common priests   contemplatives     if anything better than    truth     self control     endurance             relinquishment   here can be found   how could i go ask   common priests   contemplatives       now that today i understand          what benefits          the next life  it was truly for my well being   that the awakened one came          to stay in alavi    today i understand   where what is given   bears great fruit   i will wander from village to village     town to town     paying homage  to the self awakened one     the true rightness of the dhamma    i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at savatthi  in jeta s grove  anathapindika s monastery  there he addressed the monks   monks    yes  lord   the monks replied  the blessed one said   monks  the ending of the fermentations is for one who knows and sees  i tell you  not for one who does not know and does not see  for one who knows what and sees what  appropriate attention and inappropriate attention  when a monk attends inappropriately  un arisen fermentations arise  and arisen fermentations increase  when a monk attends appropriately  un arisen fermentations do not arise  and arisen fermentations are abandoned  there are fermentations to be abandoned by seeing  those to be abandoned by restraining  those to be abandoned by using  those to be abandoned by tolerating  those to be abandoned by avoiding  those to be abandoned by destroying  and those to be abandoned by developing       and what are the fermentations to be abandoned by seeing  there is the case where an uninstructed  run of the mill person    who has no regard for noble ones  is not well versed or disciplined in their dhamma  who has no regard for men of integrity  is not well versed or disciplined in their dhamma    does not discern what ideas are fit for attention or what ideas are unfit for attention  this being so  he does not attend to ideas fit for attention and attends  instead  to ideas unfit for attention   and what are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends to  whatever ideas such that  when he attends to them  the un arisen fermentation of sensuality arises in him  and the arisen fermentation of sensuality increases  the un arisen fermentation of becoming arises in him  and arisen fermentation of becoming increases  the un arisen fermentation of ignorance arises in him  and the arisen fermentation of ignorance increases  these are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends to   and what are the ideas fit for attention that he does not attend to  whatever ideas such that  when he attends to them  the un arisen fermentation of sensuality does not arise in him  and the arisen fermentation of sensuality is abandoned  the un arisen fermentation of becoming does not arise in him  and arisen fermentation of becoming is abandoned  the un arisen fermentation of ignorance does not arise in him  and the arisen fermentation of ignorance is abandoned  these are the ideas fit for attention that he does not attend to  through his attending to ideas unfit for attention and through his not attending to ideas fit for attention  both un arisen fermentations arise in him  and arisen fermentations increase   this is how he attends inappropriately   was i in the past  was i not in the past  what was i in the past  how was i in the past  having been what  what was i in the past  shall i be in the future  shall i not be in the future  what shall i be in the future  how shall i be in the future  having been what  what shall i be in the future     or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present   am i  am i not  what am i  how am i  where has this being come from  where is it bound    as he attends inappropriately in this way  one of six kinds of view arises in him  the view i have a self arises in him as true and established  or the view i have no self    or the view it is precisely by means of self that i perceive self    or the view it is precisely by means of self that i perceive not self    or the view it is precisely by means of not self that i perceive self arises in him as true and established  or else he has a view like this  this very self of mine    the knower that is sensitive here and there to the ripening of good and bad actions    is the self of mine that is constant  everlasting  eternal  not subject to change  and will endure as long as eternity  this is called a thicket of views  a wilderness of views  a contortion of views  a writhing of views  a fetter of views  bound by a fetter of views  the uninstructed run of the mill person is not freed from birth  aging  and death  from sorrow  lamentation  pain  distress  and despair  he is not freed  i tell you  from suffering and stress   the well instructed disciple of the noble ones    who has regard for noble ones  is well versed and disciplined in their dhamma  who has regard for men of integrity  is well versed and disciplined in their dhamma    discerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are unfit for attention  this being so  he does not attend to ideas unfit for attention and attends  instead  to ideas fit for attention   and what are the ideas unfit for attention that he does not attend to  whatever ideas such that  when he attends to them  the un arisen fermentation of sensuality arises in him  and the arisen fermentation of sensuality increases  the un arisen fermentation of becoming arises in him  and arisen fermentation of becoming increases  the un arisen fermentation of ignorance arises in him  and the arisen fermentation of ignorance increases  these are the ideas unfit for attention that he does not attends to   and what are the ideas fit for attention that he does attend to  whatever ideas such that  when he attends to them  the un arisen fermentation of sensuality does not arise in him  and the arisen fermentation of sensuality is abandoned  the un arisen fermentation of becoming does not arise in him  and the arisen fermentation of becoming is abandoned  the un arisen fermentation of ignorance does not arise in him  and the arisen fermentation of ignorance is abandoned  these are the ideas fit for attention that he does attend to  through his not attending to ideas unfit for attention and through his attending to ideas fit for attention  un arisen fermentations do not arise in him  and arisen fermentations are abandoned   he attends appropriately  this is stress   this is the origination of stress   this is the cessation of stress   this is the way leading to the cessation of stress  as he attends appropriately in this way  three fetters are abandoned in him  identity view  doubt  and grasping at precepts and practices  these are called the fermentations to be abandoned by seeing       and what are the fermentations to be abandoned by restraining  there is the case where a monk  reflecting appropriately  dwells restrained with the restraint of the eye faculty  the fermentations  vexation  or fever that would arise if he were to dwell unrestrained with the restraint of the eye faculty do not arise for him when he dwells restrained with the restraint of the eye faculty  reflecting appropriately  he dwells restrained with the restraint of the ear faculty    reflecting appropriately  he dwells restrained with the restraint of the nose faculty    reflecting appropriately  he dwells restrained with the restraint of the tongue faculty    reflecting appropriately  he dwells restrained with the restraint of the body faculty    reflecting appropriately  he dwells restrained with the restraint of the intellect faculty  the fermentations  vexation  or fever that would arise if he were to dwell unrestrained with the restraint of the intellect faculty do not arise for him when he dwells restrained with the restraint of the intellect faculty  these are called the fermentations to be abandoned by restraining       and what are the fermentations to be abandoned by using  there is the case where a monk  reflecting appropriately  uses the robe simply to counteract cold  to counteract heat  to counteract the touch of flies  mosquitoes  wind  sun  and reptiles  simply for the purpose of covering the parts of the body that cause shame   reflecting appropriately  he uses alms food  not playfully  nor for intoxication  nor for putting on bulk  nor for beautification  but simply for the survival and continuance of this body  for ending its afflictions  for the support of the holy life  thinking   thus will i destroy old feelings  of hunger  and not create new feelings  from overeating   i will maintain myself  be blameless  and live in comfort    reflecting appropriately  he uses lodging simply to counteract cold  to counteract heat  to counteract the touch of flies  mosquitoes  wind  sun  and reptiles  simply for protection from the inclemency   s of weather and for the enjoyment of seclusion   reflecting appropriately  he uses medicinal requisites that are used for curing the sick simply to counteract any pains of illness that have arisen and for maximum freedom from disease   the fermentations  vexation  or fever that would arise if he were not to use these things  in this way  do not arise for him when he uses them  in this way   these are called the fermentations to be abandoned by using   and what are the fermentations to be abandoned by tolerating  there is the case where a monk  reflecting appropriately  endures  he tolerates cold  heat  hunger  and thirst  the touch of flies  mosquitoes  wind  sun  and reptiles  ill spoken  unwelcome words and bodily feelings that  when they arise  are painful  racking  sharp  piercing  disagreeable  displeasing  and menacing to life  the fermentations  vexation  or fever that would arise if he were not to tolerate these things do not arise for him when he tolerates them  these are called the fermentations to be abandoned by tolerating       and what are the fermentations to be abandoned by avoiding  there is the case where a monk  reflecting appropriately  avoids a wild elephant  a wild horse  a wild bull  a wild dog  a snake  a stump  a bramble patch  a chasm  a cliff  a cesspool  and an open sewer  reflecting appropriately  he avoids sitting in the sorts of unsuitable seats  wandering to the sorts of unsuitable habitats  and associating with the sorts of bad friends that would make his knowledgeable friends in the holy life suspect him of evil conduct  the fermentations  vexation  or fever that would arise if he were not to avoid these things do not arise for him when he avoids them  these are called the fermentations to be abandoned by avoiding       and what are the fermentations to be abandoned by destroying  there is the case where a monk  reflecting appropriately  does not tolerate an arisen thought of sensuality  he abandons it  destroys it  dispels it  and wipes it out of existence  reflecting appropriately  he does not tolerate an arisen thought of ill will     reflecting appropriately  he does not tolerate an arisen thought of cruelty    reflecting appropriately  he does not tolerate arisen evil  unskillful mental qualities  he abandons them  destroys them  dispels them  and wipes them out of existence  the fermentations  vexation  or fever that would arise if he were not to destroy these things do not arise for him when he destroys them  these are called the fermentations to be abandoned by destroying       and what are the fermentations to be abandoned by developing  there is the case where a monk  reflecting appropriately  develops mindfulness as a factor of awakening dependent on seclusion   dispassion   cessation  resulting in letting go  he develops analysis of qualities as a factor of awakening   persistence as a factor of awakening   rapture as a factor of awakening   serenity as a factor of awakening   concentration as a factor of awakening   equanimity as a factor of awakening dependent on seclusion   dispassion   cessation  resulting in letting go  the fermentations  vexation  or fever that would arise if he were not to develop these qualities do not arise for him when he develops them  these are called the fermentations to be abandoned by developing   when a monk s fermentations that should be abandoned by seeing have been abandoned by seeing  his fermentations that should be abandoned by restraining have been abandoned by restraining  his fermentations that should be abandoned by using have been abandoned by using  his fermentations that should be abandoned by tolerating have been abandoned by tolerating  his fermentations that should be abandoned by avoiding have been abandoned by avoiding  his fermentations that should be abandoned by destroying have been abandoned by destroying  his fermentations that should be abandoned by developing have been abandoned by developing  then he is called a monk who dwells restrained with the restraint of all the fermentations  he has severed craving  thrown off the fetters  and    through the right penetration of conceit    has made an end of suffering and stress   that is what the blessed one said  gratified  the monks delighted in the blessed one s words  i heard thus  at one time the blessed one was living in the squirrels    sanctuary in the bamboo grove in rajagaha  at that time venerable rahula lived in ambalatthika  then the blessed one getting up from his seclusion in the evening approached venerable rahula in ambalatthika  venerable rahula saw the blessed one coming in the distance  prepared a seat and administered water  the blessed one sat on the prepared seat and washed his feet  venerable rahula too worshipped the blessed one and sat on a side  then the blessed one retained a little water in the vessel and addressed venerable rahula     rahula  do you see this little water left over in the vessel        yes  venerable sir        so little is his recluse ship  that has no shame  to tell lies  aware    then the blessed one threw away that little bit of water and addressed venerable rahula     rahula  did you see that little water thrown away        yes  venerable sir       thus thrown away is the recluse ship of one who has no shame  to tell lies with awareness     then the blessed one turned that vessel upside down and addressed venerable rahula    rahula  do you see this vessel turned upside down        yes  venerable sir       thus turned upside down is the recluse ship of one who has no shame to tell lies with awareness     then the blessed one put the vessel upright and addressed venerable rahula     rahula  do you see this vessel empty and deserted        yes  venerable sir       so empty is the recluse ship of one who has no shame to tell lies with awareness  rahula  the king   s huge well trained tusker  gone to the battle field  would work with his fore feet  hind feet  the fore part of his body  the hind part of his body  the head  his ears  tusks and with his tail  while protecting his trunk  then it occurs to the elephant driver  this kings    elephant the huge tusker gone to the battle field works with his fore feet and hind feet  fore part of the body and hind part of the body  with head  ears  tusks and tail  while protecting its trunk  there is nothing more to do to him  rahula  just as there is nothing the king   s huge tusker gone to the battle field could not do with is limbs large and small  in the same manner  there is nothing that could not be done by one who has no shame to tell lies with awareness  therefore you should train  i will not tell lies even for play  rahula  what is the purpose of a mirror        venerable sir  for the purpose of reflection        rahula in the same manner reflecting you should do bodily actions  reflecting you should do verbal actions  reflecting you should do mental actions     rahula  when a desire arises to do some bodily action  you should reflect  doing this bodily action  will i be troubled  will others be troubled  will both be troubled  is this bodily action demerit  is it unpleasant  when reflecting if you know     this bodily action will bring trouble to me  to others and to both it is demerit  it is unpleasant  if possible you should not do it  rahula  when  reflecting  if you know     this bodily action i desire to do  will not bring me  trouble  others trouble  nor trouble to either  it   s merit and brings pleasantness  rahula  you should do such bodily actions  even while doing that bodily action  you should reflect  does this bodily action give me trouble  give others trouble or does it give trouble to either  is it demerit  is it unpleasant  rahula  when reflecting if you know this bodily action is unpleasant  give up such bodily actions  if you know     this bodily action does not give me  others or either  trouble  it is merit  and it brings pleasantness     then follow up that bodily action  rahula  having done such actions too you should reflect  did this bodily action cause me  others  or either  trouble  was it demerit  did it arouse unpleasantness  when reflecting if you know  this bodily action caused me and others  trouble  it isn   t merit  aroused unpleasantness  then you should declare it to the teacher or a wise co associate in the holy life  manifest it and make amends for future restraint  rahula  when reflecting  if you know  this bodily action did not cause me  others or either trouble  it was merit and pleasant  then you should abide delighted pursuing such things of merit day and night   rahula  when a desire arises to you to do some verbal action  you should reflect thus  doing this verbal action  will i trouble my self  others or both  is this verbal action demerit  is it unpleasant  when reflecting if you know  this verbal action will bring me  others and both trouble it is demerit and unpleasant  if possible you should not do it  rahula  when  reflecting  if you know  this verbal action  if done  would not trouble either     it is merit and is pleasant  then rahula  you should do such verbal actions  even while doing that verbal action  you should reflect     does this verbal action give me  others  or either  trouble  is it demerit  is it unpleasant     rahula  if it is unpleasant  give up such verbal actions  if you know     this verbal action does not bring me  others  or either  trouble  it is merit and is pleasant     follow up such verbal actions  rahula  having done such verbal actions too you should reflect     did this cause me  others  or either  trouble  was it demerit  was it unpleasant  when reflecting if you know  this verbal action caused me  others  and both  trouble  it is demerit  and unpleasant     it should be declared to the teacher or a wise co associate in the holy life  manifest it and make amends for future restraint  rahula  when reflecting you know     this verbal action did not cause me  others or either trouble  it was merit and it was pleasant  then you should abide delighted pursuing such things of merit day and night  rahula  when you desire to do some mental action  you should reflect     in doing this mental action  will i trouble myself  is it demerit  is it unpleasant  when reflecting if you know     this mental action will trouble me  it is demerit and unpleasant     then  if possible you should not do it  rahula  when reflecting if you know     this mental action will not bring me trouble  it is merit and pleasant     then rahula  you should do such mental actions  even while doing that mental action  you should reflect     does this mental action give me  others  trouble  is it demerit and unpleasant     rahula  if that is so  give up that mental action  if you know     this mental action does not bring me  others trouble  it   s merit  and pleasant     then follow it up  having done such mental actions too you should reflect     did it cause me  others  trouble  was it demerit  was it unpleasant     when reflecting if you know     this mental action caused me  others  trouble  it is demerit and unpleasant     then you should be disgusted and loathe such mental actions  rahula  when reflecting if you know     this mental action did not cause me  others  trouble  it was merit and it was pleasant     then you should pursue such things of merit day and night delightedly  rahula  whoever recluses or brahmins purified their bodily actions  verbal actions and mental actions in the past  did by reflecting  whoever recluses or brahmins will purify their bodily  verbal and mental actions in the future will do so reflecting  whoever recluses or brahmins purify their bodily  verbal  and mental actions at present do so reflecting  therefore rahula  you should train thus     reflecting i will purify my bodily  verbal and mental actions     the blessed one said thus and venerable rahula delighted in the words of the blessed one  i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at rajagaha  at the bamboo grove  the squirrels  feeding ground  at that time ven  rahula     was staying at the mango stone  then the blessed one  arising from his seclusion in the late afternoon  went to where ven  rahula was staying at the mango stone  ven  rahula saw him coming from afar and  on seeing him  set out a seat and water for washing the feet  the blessed one sat down on the seat set out and  having sat down  washed his feet  ven  rahula  bowing down to the blessed one  sat down to one side  then the blessed one  having left a little bit of the remaining water in the water dipper  said to ven  rahula   rahula  do you see this little bit of remaining water left in the water dipper    yes sir    that s how little of a contemplative     there is in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie   having tossed away the little bit of remaining water  the blessed one said to ven  rahula   rahula  do you see how this little bit of remaining water is tossed away    yes  sir    whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is tossed away just like that  having turned the water dipper upside down  the blessed one said to ven  rahula   rahula  do you see how this water dipper is turned upside down    yes  sir    whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is turned upside down just like that   having turned the water dipper right side up  the blessed one said to ven  rahula   rahula  do you see how empty and hollow this water dipper is    yes  sir    whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is empty and hollow just like that   rahula  it s like a royal elephant  immense  pedigreed  accustomed to battles  its tusks like chariot poles  having gone into battle  it uses its forefeet and hind feet  its forequarters and hindquarters  its head and ears and tusks and tail  but will simply hold back its trunk  the elephant trainer notices that and thinks   this royal elephant has not given up its life to the king   but when the royal elephant    having gone into battle  uses its forefeet and hind feet  its forequarters and hindquarters  its head and ears and tusks and tail and his trunk  the trainer notices that and thinks   this royal elephant has given up its life to the king  there is nothing it will not do    the same holds true with anyone who feels no shame in telling a deliberate lie  there is no evil  i tell you  he will not do  thus  rahula  you should train yourself   i will not tell a deliberate lie even in jest    how do you construe this  rahula  what is a mirror for    for reflection  sir    in the same way  rahula  bodily acts  verbal acts  and mental acts are to be done with repeated reflection   whenever you want to perform a bodily act  you should reflect on it   this bodily act i want to perform    would it lead to self affliction  to the affliction of others  or to both  is it an unskillful bodily act  with painful consequences  painful results   if  on reflection  you know that it would lead to self affliction  to the affliction of others  or to both  it would be an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences  painful results  then any bodily act of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to do  but if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction    it would be a skillful bodily action with happy consequences  happy results  then any bodily act of that sort is fit for you to do   while you are performing a bodily act  you should reflect on it   this bodily act i am doing    is it leading to self affliction  to the affliction of others  or to both  is it an unskillful bodily act  with painful consequences  painful results   if  on reflection  you know that it is leading to self affliction  to affliction of others  or both    you should give it up  but if on reflection you know that it is not    you may continue with it   having performed a bodily act  you should reflect on it    if  on reflection  you know that it led to self affliction  to the affliction of others  or to both  it was an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences  painful results  then you should confess it  reveal it  lay it open to the teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy life  having confessed it    you should exercise restraint in the future  but if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction    it was a skillful bodily action with happy consequences  happy results  then you should stay mentally refreshed and joyful  training day and night in skillful mental qualities   whenever you want to perform a verbal act  you should reflect on it   this verbal act i want to perform    would it lead to self affliction  to the affliction of others  or to both  is it an unskillful verbal act  with painful

reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction    it was a skillful mental action with happy consequences  happy results  then you should stay mentally refreshed and joyful  training day and night in skillful mental qualities   rahula  all those priests and contemplatives in the course of the past who purified their bodily acts  verbal acts  and mental acts  did it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts  verbal acts  and mental acts in just this way   all those priests and contemplatives in the course of the future who will purify their bodily acts  verbal acts  and mental acts  will do it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts  verbal acts  and mental acts in just this way   all those priests and contemplatives at present who purify their bodily acts  verbal acts  and mental acts  do it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts  verbal acts  and mental acts in just this way   therefore  rahula  you should train yourself   i will purify my bodily acts through repeated reflection  i will purify my verbal acts through repeated reflection  i will purify my mental acts through repeated reflection   that is how you should train yourself   that is what the blessed one said  gratified  ven  rahula delighted in the blessed one s words  thus have i heard  once the lord was touring kosala with a large number of monks  some five hundred  and he came to a kosalan brahmin village called icchanankala  and he stayed in the dense jungle of icchanankala  at that time the brahmin pokkharasati was living at ukkhattha  a populous place  full of grass  timber  water and corn  which had been given to him by king pasenadi of kosala as a royal gift with royal powers  and pokkharasati heard say   the ascetic gotama  son of the sakyans  who has gone forth from the sakyan clan  is staying in the dense jungle of icchanankala  and concerning that blessed lord a good report has been spread about     this blessed lord is an arahant  a fully enlightened buddha  perfected in knowledge and conduct  a well farer  knower of the worlds  unequalled trainer of men to be tamed  teacher of gods and humans  a buddha  a blessed lord     he proclaims this world with its gods  maras  brahmas  the world of ascetics and brahmins with its princes and people  having come to know it by his own knowledge  he teaches a dhamma that is ending  in the spirit and in the letter  and he displays the fully perfected  thoroughly purified holy life  and indeed it is good to see such arahants   now  at that time pokkharasati had a pupil  the youth ambattha  who was a student of the vedas  who knew the mantras  perfected in the three vedas  a skilled expounder of the rules and rituals  the lore of sounds and meanings and  fifthly  oral tradition  complete in philosophy and the marks of a great man  admitted and accepted by his master in the three vedas with the words   what i know  you know  what you know  i know     and pokkharasati said to ambattha   ambattha  my son  the ascetic gotama  son of the sakyans  who has gone forth from the sakyan clan  is staying in the dense jungle of icchanankala  and concerning that blessed lord a good report has been spread about     this blessed lord is an arahant  a fully enlightened buddha  perfected in knowledge and conduct  a well farer  knower of the worlds  unequalled trainer of men to be tamed  teacher of gods and humans  a buddha  a blessed lord     now you go to see the ascetic gotama and find out whether this report is correct or not  and whether the reverend gotama is as they say or not  in that way we shall put the reverend gotama to the test    sir  how shall i find out whether the report is true  or whether the reverend gotama is as they say or not    according to the tradition of our mantras  ambattha  the great man who is possessed of the thirty two marks of a great man has only two courses open to him  if he lives the household life he will become a ruler  a wheel turning righteous monarch of the law  conqueror of the four quarters  who has established the security of his realm and is possessed of the seven treasures  these are  the wheel treasure  the elephant treasure  the horse treasure  the jewel treasure  the woman treasure  the householder treasure  and  as a seventh  the counselor treasure  he has more than a thousand sons who are heroes  of heroic stature  conquerors of the hostile army  he dwells having conquered the sea girt land without a stick or sword  by the law  but if he goes forth from the household life into homelessness  then he will become an arahant  a fully enlightened buddha  one who draws back the view from the world  and  ambattha  i am the passer on of the mantras  and you are the receiver    very good  sir  said ambattha at pokkharasati   s words  and he got up  passed by pokkharasati with his right side  got into his chariot drawn by a mare and  accompanied by a number of young me  headed for the dense jungle of icchanankala  he drove as far as the carriage would go  then alighted and continued on foot  at that time a number of monks were walking up and down in the open air  ambattha approached them and said   where is the reverend gotama to be found just now  we have come to see the reverend gotama   the monks considered ambattha and thought   this is ambattha  a youth of good family and a pupil of the distinguished brahmin pokkharasati  the lord would not mind having a conversation with such a young man   and they said to ambattha   that is his dwelling  with the door closed  go quietly up to it  go on to the veranda without haste  cough  and knock on the bolt  the lord will open the door to you   ambattha went up to the dwelling and onto the veranda  coughed  and knocked  the lord opened the door  and ambattha went it  the young men entered  exchanged courtesies with the lord  and sat down to one side  but ambattha walked up and down while the lord sat there  uttered some vague words of politeness  and then stood so speaking before the seated lord   that was considered very rude behavior  and the lord said to ambattha   well now  ambattha  would you behave like this if you were talking to venerable and learned brahmins  teachers of teachers  as you do with me  walking and standing while i am sitting  and uttering vague words of politeness    no  reverend gotama  a brahmin should walk with a walking brahmin  stand with a standing brahmin  sit with a sitting brahmin  sit with a sitting brahmin  and lie down with a brahmin who is lying down  but as for those shaven little ascetics  menials  black scourings from brahmas foot  with them it is fitting to speak just as i do with the reverend gotama    but  ambattha  you came here seeking something  whatever it was you came for  you should listen attentively to hear about it  ambattha  you have not perfected your training  your conceit of being trained is due to nothing but inexperience   but ambattha was angry and displeased at being called untrained  and he turned on the lord with curses and insults  thinking   the ascetic gotama bears me ill will  he said   reverend gotama  the sakyans are fierce  rough spoken  touchy and violent  being of menial origin  being menials  they do not honor  respect  esteem  revere or pay homage to brahmins  with regard to this it is not proper that they  behave in such a manner and  do not pay homage to brahmins   he is complaining that they do not honor the rigid  caste system  of india     biona webmaster  this was the first time ambattha accused the sakyans of being menials   but  ambattha  what have the sakyans done to you    reverend gotama  once i went to kapilavatthu on some business for my teacher  the brahmin pokkharasati  and i cam to the sakyans meeting hall  and at that time a lot of sakyans were sitting on high seats in their meeting hall  poking each other with their fingers  laughing and playing about together  and it seemed to me that they were just making fun of me  and no offered me a seat  with regard to this  it is not proper that they do not pay homage to the brahmins   this was the second time ambattha accused the sakyans of being menials   but  ambattha  even the quail  that little bird  can talk as she likes in her own nest  kapilavatthu is the sakyans home  ambattha  they do not deserve censure for such a trifle    reverend gotama  there are four castes  the khattiyas  the brahmins  the merchants and the artisans  and of these four castes  three     the khattiyas  the merchants  and the artisans     are entirely subservient to the brahmins   this was the third time ambattha accused the sakyans of being menials  then the lord thought   this young man goes too far is abusing the sakyans  suppose i were to ask after his clan name   so he said   ambattha  what is your clan    i am a kanhayan  reverend gotama    ambattha  in former days  according to those who remember the ancestral lineage  the sakyans were the masters  and you are descended from a slave girl of the sakyans  for the sakyans regard to king okkaka  to whom his queen was dear and beloved  wishing to transfer the kingdom to her son  banished his elder brothers from the kingdom     okkamukha  karandu  hatthiniya  and sinipura  and these  being banished  made their home on the flank of the himalayas beside a lotus pond where there was a growth of teak trees  and for fear of contaminating their stock they cohabitated with their own sisters  then king okkaha asked his ministers and counselors   where are the princes living now   and they told him  at this  king okkaha exclaimed   they are strong as saka trees  these princes  they are real sakyans   and this how the sakyans go their well known name  and the king was the ancestor of the sakyans   now king okkaha has a slave girl called disa  who gave birth to a kanha  dirty  black  child  the black thing  when it was born  exclaimed   wash me  mother  bath me  mother  deliver me from this dirt and i will bring you profit   because  ambattha  just as people today use the term hobgoblin as a term of abuse  so in those days did they say kanha  and they said   as soon as he was born  he spoke  he is born a kanha  a hobgoblin   that is how  in former days according to those who remember the ancestral lineage  the sakyans were the masters  and you are descended from a slave girl of the sakyans   on hearing this  the young men said   reverend gotama  do not humiliate ambattha too much with talk of his being descended from a slave girl  ambattha is well born  of a good family  he is very learned  he is well spoken  a scholar  well able to hold his own in this discussion with the reverend gotama   then the lord said to the young men   if you consider that ambattha is ill born  not of good family  unlearned  ill spoke  unable to hold his own in this discussion with the ascetic gotama  then let ambattha be silent  and you conduct this discussion with me  but if you think he is well born  of a good family  he is very learned  he is well spoken  a scholar  able to hold his own  then you be quiet and let him discuss with me    ambattha is well born  reverend gotama  of a good family  he is very learned  he is well spoken  a scholar  able to hold his own  we shall be silent  he shall continue   then the lord said to ambattha   ambattha  i have a fundamental question for you  which you will not like to answer  if you don   t answer  or if you evade the issue  if you keep silent or go away  your head will split into seven pieces  what do you think  ambattha  have you heard from old and venerable brahmins  teachers of teachers  where the kanhayans came from  or who was their ancestor   at this  ambattha remained silent  and the lord said   answer me now  ambattha  this is not the time for silence  whoever  ambattha  does not answer a fundamental question put to him by a tath  gata by the third asking has his head split into seven pieces    this is a pre buddhist mythos that  as rhys davids observes  never comes to anything   and at that moment vajrapani the yaksha   this god is also called  indra   he is ready to make good on the mytho mentioned above  the old gods are supporting the new religion  vajrapani also appears as a bodhisattva in later mahayana sutras   holding up a huge iron club  flaming  ablaze and glowing  up in the sky just above ambattha was thinking   if this young man does not answer a proper question put to him by the blessed lord by the third time of asking  i   ll split his head into seven pieces   the lord saw vajrapani  and so did ambattha  and at the sight  ambattha was terrified and unnerved  his hairs stood on end  and he sought protection  shelter  and safety from the lord  crouching down close to the lord  he said   what did the reverend gotama say  may the reverend gotama repeat what he said    what do you think  ambattha  have you heard from old and venerable brahmins  teachers of teachers  where the kanhayans came from  or who was their ancestor    yes  i have heard it just as the reverend gotama said  that is where the kanhayans came from  he was their ancestor  hearing this  the young men made a loud noise and clamor   so ambattha is ill born  not of a good family  born of a slave girl of the sakyans  and the sakyans are ambattha   s masters  we disparages the ascetic gotama  thinking he was not speaking the truth   then the lord thought   it is too much  the way these young men humiliate ambattha for being the ancestor of a slave girl  i must get him out of this   so he said to the young men   don   t disparage ambattha too much for being the ancestor of a slave girl  that kahna was a mighty sage  known more commonly today as krishna   biona webmaster   he went to the south country  learnt the mantras of the brahmins there  and then went to king okkaka and asked for his daughter maddarupi  and okkaka  furiously angry  exclaimed   so this fellow  the son of a slave girl  wants my daughter   and put an arrow to his bow  but he unable either to shoot to arrow or to withdraw it  then the ministers and the counselors came together to the sage kanha and said   spare the king  reverend sir  spare the king    the king will be safe  but if he looses the arrow downwards  the earth will quake as far as his kingdom extends    reverend sir  spare the king  spare the land    the king and the land will be safe  but if he looses the arrow upwards  as for as his realm extends the god will not let it rain for seven years   according to rhys davids this is a bluff  as the spell could only stop the discharge of an arrow    reverend sir  spare the king  spare the land  and may the god let it rain    the king and the land will be safe  and the god will let it rain  but if the king points the arrow at the crown prince  the prince will be completely safe    then the ministers exclaimed   let king okkaka point the arrow at the crown prince  the prince will be perfectly safe   the king did so and the prince was unharmed  then king okkaka  terrified and fearful of divine punishment gave away his daughter to maddarupi  so  young men  do not disparage ambattha too much for being the ancestor of a slave girl  that kahna was a mighty sage   then the lord said   ambattha  what do you think  suppose a khattiya youth were to wed a brahmin maiden  and there was a son of the union  would that son of a khattiya youth and a brahmin maiden receive a seat and water from the brahmins    he would  reverend gotama      would they allow him to eat at funeral rites  at rice offerings  at sacrifices  or as a guest    they would  reverend gotama    would they teach him mantras or not    they would  reverend gotama    would they keep their women covered or uncovered    uncovered  reverend gotama    but would the khattiyas sprinkle him with the khattiya consencration    no  reverend gotama    why not    because  reverend gotama  he is not well born on his mothers side    what do you think  ambattha  suppose a brahmin youth were to wed a khattiya maiden  and there was a son of the union  would that son of a khattiya youth and a brahmin maiden receive a seat and water from the brahmins    he would  reverend gotama    he would  reverend gotama    would they allow him to eat at funeral rites  at rice offerings  at sacrifices  or as a guest    they would  reverend gotama    would they teach him mantras or not    they would  reverend gotama    would they keep their women covered or uncovered    uncovered  reverend gotama    but would the khattiyas sprinkle him with the khattiya consecration    no  reverend gotama    why not    because  reverend gotama  he is not well born on his fathers side    so  ambattha  the khattiyas  through a man taking a woman or a woman taking a man  are senior to the brahmins  what do you think  ambattha  take the case of a brahmin who  for some reason  has had his head shaved by the brahmins  has been punished with a bag of ashes and banished from the country or the city    would he receive a seat and water from the brahmins      no  reverend gotama    would they allow him to eat at funeral rites  at rice offerings  at sacrifices  or as a guest      no  reverend gotama    would they teach him mantras  or not      they would not  reverend gotama    would they keep their women covered or uncovered      covered  reverend gotama    what do you think  ambattha    take the case of a khattiya who  for some reason  had his head shaved by the khattiyas  has been punished with a bag of ashes and banished from the country or the city    would he receive a seat and water from the brahmins      he would  reverend gotama    would they keep their women covered or uncovered      uncovered  reverend gotama    but that khattiya has so far reached the extreme of humiliation that he has     been banished from the country or the city    so even if a khattiya has suffered extreme humiliation  he is superior and the brahmins inferior   ambittha  this verse was pronounced by brahma sanankumara   the khattiya   s best among those who value clan      he with knowledge and conduct is best of gods and men    this verse was rightly sung  not wrongly  rightly spoken  not wrongly  connected with profit  not unconnected    and  ambattha  i too say this   the khattiya   s best among those who value clan       he with knowledge and conduct is best of gods and men    but  reverend gotama  what is this conduct  what is this knowledge    ambattha  it is not from the standpoint of the attainment of unexcelled knowledge and conduct that reputation based on birth and clan is declared  nor on the conceit which says     you are worthy of me  you are not worthy of me      for wherever there is a giving  a taking  or a giving and taking in marriage  there is always this talk and this conceit     but those who are enslaved by such things are far from the attainment of the unexcelled knowledge and conduct  which is attained by abandoning all such things    but  reverend gotama  what is this conduct  what is this knowledge    ambattha  a tath  gata arises in this world  an arahant  fully enlightened buddha  endowed with wisdom and conduct  well farer  knower of the worlds  incomparable trainer of men to be tamed  teacher of gods and humans  enlightened and blessed    he  having realized it by his own super knowledge  proclaims this world with its devas  maras and brahmas  its princes and people    he preaches the dhamma which is lovely in its beginning  lovely in its middle  lovely in its ending  in the spirit and in the letter  and displays the fully perfected and purified holy life  a disciple goes forth and practices the moralities   he guards the sense doors  etc    attains the four jhanas  thus he develops conduct    he attains various insights  and the cessation of the corruptions   and beyond this there is no further development of knowledge and conduct that is higher or more perfect   but  ambattha  in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct  there are four paths of failure    what are they    in the first place  an ascetic or brahmin who has not managed to gain this unexcelled attainment  takes his carrying pole and plunges into the depths of the forest thinking      i will live on windfalls     but in this way he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained    this is the first path of failure    again  an ascetic or brahmin  being unable to live on windfalls  takes a spade and basket  thinking     i will live on tubers and roots     this is the second path of failure    again  an ascetic or brahmin  being unable to live on tubers and roots  makes a fire hearth at the edge of a village or small town and sits tending the flame   this is the third path of failure    again  an ascetic or brahmin  being unable to tend the flame  erects a house with four doors at the crossroads thinking       whatever ascetic or brahmin arrives from the four quarters  i will honor to the best of my strength and ability     but in this way he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conduct    this is the fourth path of failure   what do you think  ambattha    do you and your teacher live in accordance with this unexcelled knowledge and conduct        no indeed  reverend gotama    who are my teacher and i in comparison    we are far from it    well then  ambattha  could you and your teacher  being unable to gain this  go with your carrying poles into the depths of the forest  intending to live on windfalls      no  indeed  reverend gotama    well then  ambattha  could you and your teacher  being unable to gain this  live on tubers and roots      sit tending the flame      erect a house          no  indeed  reverend gotama    and so  ambattha  not only are you and your teacher incapable of attaining this unexcelled knowledge and conduct  but even the four paths of failure are beyond you    and yet you and your teacher the brahmin pokkharasati utter these words     these shaven little ascetics  menials  black scrapings from brahma   s foot  what converse can they have with brahmins learned in the three vedas       even though you can   t even manage the duties of one who has failed    see  ambattha  how your teacher has let you down    ambattha  the brahmin pokkharasati lives by the grace and favor of king pasenadi of kosala    and yet the king does not allow him to have audience face to face    when he confers with the king it is through a curtain    why should the king not grant audience face to face to one on whom he has bestowed a proper and blameless source of revenue    see how your teacher has let you down    what do you think  ambattha    suppose king pasenadi was sitting on the neck of an elephant or on horseback  or was standing on the chariot mat  conferring with his ministers and princes about something    and suppose he were to step aside and some workman or workman   s servant were to come along and stand in his place    and standing there he might say     this is what king pasenadi of kosala says        would he be speaking the king   s words  as if he were the king   s equal      no  indeed  reverend gotama    well then  ambattha  it is just the same thing    those who were  as you say  the first sages of the brahmins  the makers and expounders of the mantras  whose ancient verses are chanted  pronounced and collected by the brahmins of today     atthaka  vamaka  vamadeva  vessamitta  yamataggi  angirasa  bharadvaja  vasettha  kassapa  bhagu          whose mantras are said to be passed on to you and your teacher    yet you do not thereby become a sage or one practised in the way of a sage     such a thing is not possible   what do you think  ambattha    what have you heard said by brahmins who are venerable  aged  the teachers of teachers    those first sages  attaka      bhagu     did they enjoy themselves  well bathed  perfumed  their hair and beards trimmed  adorned with garlands and wreaths  dressed in white clothes  indulging in the pleasures of the five senses and addicted to them  as you and your teacher do now      no  reverend gotama    or did they eat special fine rice with the black spots removed  with various soups and curries  as you and your teacher do now      no  reverend gotama    or did they amuse themselves with women dressed up in flounces and furbelows  as you and your teacher do now      no  reverend gotama    or did they ride around in chariots drawn by mares with braided tails  that they urged on with long goad sticks      no  reverend gotama    or did they have themselves guarded in fortified towns with palisades and barricades  by men with long swords          no  reverend gotama    so  ambattha  neither you nor your teacher are a sage or one trained in the way of a sage    and now  as for your doubts and perplexities concerning me  we will clarify these by your asking me  and by my answering your questions   then  descending from his lodging  the lord started to walk up and down  and ambattha did likewise    and as he walked along with the lord  ambattha looked out for the thirty two marks of a great man on the lord   s body    and he could see all of them except for two    he was in doubt and perplexity about two of these marks    he could not make up his mind or be certain about the sheathed genitals or the large tongue  and the lord  being aware of his doubts  effected by his psychic power that ambattha could see his sheathed genitals  and then  sticking out his tongue  he reached out to lick both ears and both nostrils  and then covered the whole circle of his forehead with his tongue    then ambattha thought     the ascetic gotama is equipped with all the thirty two marks of a great man  complete and with none missing       then he said to the lord     reverend gotama  may i go now    i have much business  much to do      ambattha  do what you now think fit     so ambattha got back into his chariot drawn by mares and departed  meanwhile the brahmin pokkharasati had gone outside and was sitting in his park with a large number of brahmins  just waiting for ambattha   then ambattha came to the park    he rode in the chariot as far as it would go  and then continued on foot to where pokkharasati was  saluted him  and sat down to one side    then pokkharasati said   well  dear boy  did you see the reverend gotama      i did  sir    and was the reverend gotama such as he is reported to be  and not otherwise    and is he of such nature  and not otherwise        sir  he is as he is reported to be  and he is of such nature and not otherwise    he is possessed of the thirty two marks of a great man  all completed  with none missing    but was there any conversation between you and the ascetic gotama      there was  sir    and what was this conversation about     so ambattha told pokkharasati all that had passed between the lord and himself  at this pokkharasati exclaimed     well  you   re a fine little scholar  a fine wise man  a fine expert in the three vedas    anyone going about his business like that ought when he dies  at the breaking up of the body  to go to the downfall  to the evil path  to ruin  to hell    you have heaped insults on the reverend gotama  as a result of which he has brought up more and more things against us    you   re a fine little scholar     he was so angry and enraged that he kicked ambattha over  and wanted to start out at once to see the lord  but the brahmins said     it is far too late  sir  to go to see the ascetic gotama today    the reverend pokkharasati should go to see him tomorrow   then pokkharasati  having had fine hard and soft food prepared in his own home  set out by the light of torches from ukkattha for the jungle of icchanankala    he went by chariot as far as possible  then continued on foot to where the lord was    having exchanged courtesies with the lord  he sat down to one side and said   venerable gotama  did not our pupil ambattha come to see you      he did  brahmin      and was there any conversation between you     there was      and what was this conversation about   then the lord told pokkharasati all that had passed between him and ambattha    at this  pokkharasati said to the lord     reverend gotama  ambattha is a young fool    may the reverend gotama pardon him      brahmin  may ambattha be happy   then pokkharasati looked out for the thirty two marks of a great man on the lord   s body and he could see all of them except for two    the sheathed genitals and the large tongue  but the lord set his mind at rest about these  then  descending from his lodging  the lord started to walk up and down  and pokkharasati did likewise    and as he walked along with the lord  pokkharasati looked out for the thirty two marks of a great man on the lord   s body    and he could see all of them except for two    he was in doubt and perplexity about two of these marks    he could not make up his mind or be certain about the sheathed genitals or the large tongue and the lord  being aware of his doubts  effected by his psychic power that pokkharasati could see his sheathed genitals  and then  sticking out his tongue  he reached out to lick both ears and both nostrils  and then covered the whole circle of his forehead with his tongue    then ambattha thought     the ascetic gotama is equipped with all the thirty two marks of a great man  complete and with none missing       then he said to the lord     reverend gotama  may i go now    i have much business  much to do      pokkharasati  do what you now think fit     and pokkharasati said to the lord     may the reverend gotama accept a meal from me today together with his order of monks     and the lord consented by silence  seeing his acceptance  pokkharasati said to the lord     it is time  reverend gotama  the meal is ready     and the lord  having dressed in the early morning and taken his robe and bowl  went with his order of monks to pokkharasati   s residence  and sat down on the prepared seat    then pokkharasati personally served the lord with choice hard and soft food  and the young men served the monks    and when the lord had taken his hand from the bowl  pokkharasati sat down to one side on a low stool  and as pokkharasati sat there  the lord delivered a graduated discourse on generosity  on morality and on heaven  showing the danger  degradation and corruption of sense desires  and the profit of renunciation    and when the lord knew that pokkharasati   s mind was ready  pliable  free from the hindrances  joyful and calm  then he preached a sermon on dhamma in brief    on suffering  its origin  its cessation  and the path    and just as a clean cloth from which all stains have been removed receives the dye perfectly  so in the brahmin pokkharasati  as he sat there  there arose the pure and spotless dhamma eye  and he knew   whatever things have an origin must come to cessation   and pokkharasati  having seen  attained  experienced and penetrated the dhamma  having passed beyond doubt  transcended uncertainty  having gained perfect confidence in the teacher   s doctrine without relying on others  said     excellent  lord  excellent    it is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down  or to point out the way to one who had got lost  or to bring an oil lamp into a dark place  so that those with eyes could see what was there    just so the blessed lord has expounded the dhamma in various ways     i go with my son  my wife  my ministers and counselors for refuge to the reverend gotama  to the dhamma and to the sangha      may the reverend gotama accept me as a lay follower who has taken refuge from this day forth as long as life shall last    and whenever the reverend gotama visits other families or lay followers in ukkattha  may he also visit the family of pokkarasati    whatever young men and maidens are there will revere the reverend gotama and rise before him  will give him a seat and water and will be glad at heart  and that will be for their welfare and happiness for a long time    well said  brahmin   i heard thus  at one time the blessed one lived in anathapindika   s monastery in jeta   s grove in savatthi  the householder anathapindika was seriously ill and suffering badly at that time  he addressed a certain man and said     good man approach the blessed one  worship the blessed one for my sake with your head at his feet  and tell   venerable sir  the householder anathapindika is seriously ill  also approach venerable shariputra worship venerable shariputra for my sake with your head at his feet and tell  venerable sir  the householder anathapindika is seriously ill  it is good if venerable shariputra would approach the householder anathapindika   s house out of compassion   that man agreeing  approached the blessed one  worshipped the blessed one  sat on a side and said   venerable sir  the householder anathapindika is seriously ill and he worships the blessed one with his head at the feet of the blessed one  then he approached venerable shariputra  worshipped him  sat on a side and said   venerable sir  the householder anathapindika is seriously ill  he worships venerable shariputra with his head at the feet of venerable shariputra and also says  it is good if venerable shariputra would approach the householder anathapindika   s house out of compassion   venerable shariputra accepted the message silently  put on his robes and taking bowl and robes  and accompanied by venerable ananda as the second recluse  approached the house of anathapindika  sitting on the prepared seats venerable shariputra said     householder  how are you feeling  would you survive  are the unpleasant feelings decreasing or increasing  do the feelings show the increasing end or the decreasing end  good sir  shariputra  i do not feel well and will not survive  my unpleasant feelings are severe and increasing  not decreasing  the unpleasant feelings are increasing until the end  good sir  shariputra  my top hurts a lot  i feel as though a strong man was giving me a headdress with a strong cloth  i do not feel well and will not survive  my unpleasant feelings are severe and increasing  not decreasing  the unpleasant feelings are increasing until the end  good sir  shariputra  my belly hurts a lot as though a lot of air was turning about in my belly  i feel as though a clever butcher or his apprentice was carving my belly with a sharp butcher   s knife i do not feel well and will not survive  my unpleasant feelings are severe and increasing  not decreasing  the unpleasant feelings are increasing until the end  good sir  shariputra  there is a lot burning in my body  i feel as though two strong men taking me by my hands and feet are pulling me to a pit of burning embers and are scorching and burning me  i do not feel well and will not survive  my unpleasant feelings are severe and increasing  not decreasing  the unpleasant feelings are increasing until the end  householder  if that is so  you should train thus  i will not cling to the eye  will not be settled in eye consciousness  i will not cling to the ear  will not be settled in ear consciousness  i will not cling to

dangers  un arisen at present  will arise in the future  be alert to them and  being alert  work to get rid of them  which five  there will be  in the course of the future  monks undeveloped in bodily conduct  undeveloped in virtue  undeveloped in mind  undeveloped in discernment  they    being undeveloped in bodily conduct  undeveloped in virtue  undeveloped in mind  undeveloped in discernment    will give full ordination to others and will not be able to discipline them in heightened virtue  heightened mind  heightened discernment  these too will then be undeveloped in bodily conduct

from corrupt discipline  corrupt dhamma  this  monks  is the first future danger  un arisen at present that will arise in the future  be alert to it and  being alert  work to get rid of it  and again  there will be in the course of the future monks undeveloped in bodily conduct  undeveloped in virtue  undeveloped in mind  undeveloped in discernment  they    being undeveloped in bodily conduct  undeveloped in virtue  undeveloped in mind  undeveloped in discernment    will take on others as students and will not be able to discipline them in heightened virtue  heightened mind  heightened

in the future  be alert to it and  being alert  work to get rid of it  and again  there will be in the course of the future monks undeveloped in bodily conduct    virtue    mind    discernment  they    being undeveloped in bodily conduct    virtue    mind    discernment    will become elders living in luxury  lethargic  foremost in falling back  shirking the duties of solitude  they will not make an effort for the attaining of the as yet unattained  the reaching of the as yet un reached  the realization of the as yet unrealized  they will become an example for later generations  who will become luxurious in their living  lethargic  foremost in falling back  shirking the duties of solitude  and who will not make an effort for the attaining of the as yet unattained  the reaching of the as yet un reached  the realization of the as yet unrealized  thus from corrupt dhamma comes corrupt discipline  from corrupt discipline  corrupt dhamma  this  monks  is the fifth future danger  un arisen at present that will arise in the future  be alert to it and  being alert  work to get rid of it  these  monks  are the five future dangers  un arisen at present that will arise in the future  be alert to them and  being alert  work to get rid of them  monks  these five future dangers  un arisen at present  will arise in the future  be alert to them and  being alert  work to get rid of them  which five   there will be  in the course of the future  monks desirous of fine robes  they  desirous of fine robes  will neglect the practice of wearing cast off cloth  will neglect isolated forest and wilderness dwellings  will move to towns  cities  and royal capitals  taking up residence there  for the sake of a robe they will do many kinds of unseemly  inappropriate things  this  monks  is the first future danger  un arisen at present that will arise in the future  be alert to it and  being alert  work to get rid of it  furthermore  in the course of the future there will be monks desirous of fine food  they  desirous of fine food  will neglect the practice of going for alms  will neglect isolated forest and wilderness dwellings  will move to towns  cities  and royal capitals  taking up residence there and searching out the tip top tastes with the tip of the tongue  for the sake of food they will do many kinds of unseemly  inappropriate things  this  monks  is the second future danger  un arisen at present that will arise in the future  be alert to it and  being alert  work to get rid of it  furthermore  in the course of the future there will be monks desirous of fine lodgings  they  desirous of fine lodgings  will neglect the practice of living in the wilds  will neglect isolated forest and wilderness dwellings  will move to towns  cities  and royal capitals

future  be alert to it and  being alert  work to get rid of it  furthermore  in the course of the future there will be monks who will live in close association with nuns  female probationers  and female novices  as they interact with nuns  female probationers  and female novices  they can be expected either to lead the holy life dissatisfied or to fall into one of the grosser offenses  leaving the training  returning to a lower way of life  this  monks  is the fourth future danger  un arisen at present that will arise in the future  be alert to it and  being alert  work to get rid of it  furthermore  in the course of the future there will be monks who will live in close association with monastery attendants and novices  as they interact with monastery attendants and novices  they can be expected to live intent on storing up all kinds of possessions and to stake out crops and fields  this is the fifth future danger    this  monks  is the fifth future danger  un arisen at present that will arise in the future  be alert to it and  being alert  work to get rid of it  these  monks  are the five future dangers  un arisen at present that will arise in the future  be alert to them and  being alert  work to get rid of them  then anathapindika the householder went to the blessed one and  on arrival  having bowed down to him  sat to one side  as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him   there are these four kinds of bliss that can be attained in the proper season  on the proper occasions  by a householder enjoying the pleasures of the senses  which four  the bliss of having  the bliss of making use of wealth  the bliss of debtless ness  the bliss of blamelessness   and what is the bliss of having  there is the case where the son of a good family has wealth earned through his efforts and enterprise  amassed through the strength of his arm  and piled up through the sweat of his brow  righteous wealth righteously gained  when he thinks   i have wealth earned through my efforts and enterprise  amassed through the strength of my arm  and piled up through the sweat of my brow  righteous wealth righteously gained   he experiences bliss  he experiences joy  this is called the bliss of having   and what is the bliss of making use of wealth  there is the case where the son of a good family  using the wealth earned through his efforts and enterprise  amassed through the strength of his arm  and piled up through the sweat of his brow  righteous wealth righteously gained  partakes of his wealth and makes merit  when he thinks   using the wealth earned through my efforts and enterprise  amassed through the strength of my arm  and piled up through the sweat of my brow  righteous wealth righteously gained  i partake of wealth and make merit   he experiences bliss  he experiences joy  this is called the bliss of making use of wealth   and what is the bliss of debtless ness  there is the case where the son of a good family owes no debt  great or small  to anyone at all  when he thinks   i owe no debt  great or small  to anyone at all   he experiences bliss  he experiences joy  this is called the bliss of debtless ness   and what is the bliss of blamelessness  there is the case where a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with blameless bodily kamma  blameless verbal kamma  blameless mental kamma  when he thinks   i am endowed with blameless bodily kamma  blameless verbal kamma  blameless mental kamma   he experiences bliss  he experiences joy  this is called the bliss of blamelessness   these are the four kinds of bliss that can be attained in the proper season  on the proper occasions  by a householder enjoying the pleasures of the senses   knowing the bliss of debtless ness    and recollecting the bliss of having    enjoying the bliss of wealth  the mortal   then sees clearly with discernment    seeing clearly    the wise one        he knows both sides    that these are not worth one sixteenth sixteenth     of the bliss of blamelessness  then the wanderer vacchagotta went to the blessed one and  on arrival  exchanged courteous greetings with him  after an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies  he sat down to one side  as he was sitting there he asked the blessed one   now then  venerable gotama  is there a self    when this was said  the blessed one was silent    then is there no self    a second time  the blessed one was silent   then vacchagotta the wanderer got up from his seat and left   then  not long after vacchagotta the wanderer had left  ven  ananda said to the blessed one   why  lord  did the blessed one not answer when asked a question by vacchagotta the wanderer     ananda  if i    being asked by vacchagotta the wanderer if there is a self    were to answer that there is a self  that would be conforming with those priests and contemplatives who are exponents of eternalism  the view that there is an eternal  unchanging soul   if i    being asked by vacchagotta the wanderer if there is no self    were to answer that there is no self  that would be conforming with those priests and contemplatives who are exponents of annihilationism  the view that death is the annihilation of consciousness   if i    being asked by vacchagotta the wanderer if there is a self    were to answer that there is a self  would that be in keeping with the arising of knowledge that all phenomena are not self    no  lord     and if i    being asked by vacchagotta the wanderer if there is no self    were to answer that there is no self  the bewildered vacchagotta would become even more bewildered   does the self i used to have now not exist     i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near savatthi in jeta s grove  anathapindika s park  then ven  ananda went to the blessed one and  on arrival  bowed down to him and sat to one side  as he was sitting there he addressed the blessed one  saying   is there one quality that  when developed and pursued  brings four qualities to completion  and four qualities that  when developed and pursued  bring seven qualities to completion  and seven qualities that  when developed and pursued  bring two qualities to completion     yes  ananda  there is one quality that  when developed and pursued  brings four qualities to completion  and four qualities that  when developed and pursued  bring seven qualities to completion  and seven qualities that  when developed and pursued  bring two qualities to completion  and what is the one quality that  when developed and pursued  brings four qualities to completion  what are the four qualities that  when developed and pursued  bring seven qualities to completion  what are the seven qualities that  when developed and pursued  bring two qualities to completion    mindfulness of in and out breathing  when developed and pursued  brings the four frames of reference  foundations of mindfulness  to completion  the four frames of reference  when developed and pursued  bring the seven factors for awakening to completion  the seven factors for awakening  when developed and pursued  bring clear knowing and release to completion    now how is mindfulness of in and out breathing developed and pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination    there is the case where a monk  having gone to the wilderness  to the shade of a tree  or to an empty building  sits down folding his legs crosswise  holding his body erect  and setting mindfulness to the fore  always mindful  he breathes in  mindful he breathes out        breathing in long  he discerns that he is breathing in long  or breathing out long  he discerns that he is breathing out long      or breathing in short  he discerns that he is breathing in short  or breathing out short  he discerns that he is breathing out short      he trains himself to breathe in sensitive to the entire body  and to breathe out sensitive to the entire body      he trains himself to breathe in calming the bodily processes  and to breathe out calming the bodily processes        he trains himself to breathe in sensitive to rapture  and to breathe out sensitive to rapture      he trains himself to breathe in sensitive to pleasure  and to breathe out sensitive to pleasure      he trains himself to breathe in sensitive to mental processes  and to breathe out sensitive to mental processes      he trains himself to breathe in calming mental processes  and to breathe out calming mental processes        he trains himself to breathe in sensitive to the mind  and to breathe out sensitive to the mind       he trains himself to breathe in satisfying the mind  and to breathe out satisfying the mind       he trains himself to breathe in steadying the mind  and to breathe out steadying the mind       he trains himself to breathe in releasing the mind  and to breathe out releasing the mind         he trains himself to breathe in focusing on inconstancy  and to breathe out focusing on inconstancy       he trains himself to breathe in focusing on dispassion  literally  fading   and to breathe out focusing on dispassion       he trains himself to breathe in focusing on cessation  and to breathe out focusing on cessation       he trains himself to breathe in focusing on relinquishment  and to breathe out focusing on relinquishment         now  on whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns that he is breathing in long  or breathing out long  discerns that he is breathing out long  or breathing in short  discerns that he is breathing in short  or breathing out short  discerns that he is breathing out short  trains himself to breathe in    and    out sensitive to the entire body  trains himself to breathe in    and    out calming the bodily processes  on that occasion the monk remains focused on the body in and of itself    ardent  alert  and mindful    subduing greed and distress with reference to the world  i tell you that this    the in and out breath    is classed as a body among bodies  which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in and of itself    ardent  alert  and mindful    putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world        on whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in    and    out sensitive to rapture  trains himself to breathe in    and    out sensitive to pleasure  trains himself to breathe in    and    out sensitive to mental processes  trains himself to breathe in    and    out calming mental processes  on that occasion the monk remains focused on feelings in and of themselves    ardent  alert  and mindful    subduing greed and distress with reference to the world  i tell you that this    close attention to in and out breaths    is classed as a feeling among feelings  which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on feelings in and of themselves    ardent  alert  and mindful    putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world        on whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in    and    out sensitive to the mind  trains himself to breathe in    and    out satisfying the mind  trains himself to breathe in    and    out steadying the mind  trains himself to breathe in    and    out releasing the mind  on that occasion the monk remains focused on the mind in and of itself    ardent  alert  and mindful    subduing greed and distress with reference to the world  i don t say that there is mindfulness of in and out breathing in one of confused mindfulness and no alertness  which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in and of itself    ardent  alert  and mindful    putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world        on whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in    and    out focusing on inconstancy  trains himself to breathe in    and    out focusing on dispassion  trains himself to breathe in    and    out focusing on cessation  trains himself to breathe in    and    out focusing on relinquishment  on that occasion the monk remains focused on mental qualities in and of themselves    ardent  alert  and mindful    subduing greed and distress with reference to the world  he who sees clearly with discernment the abandoning of greed and distress is one who oversees with equanimity  which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in and of themselves    ardent  alert  and mindful    putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world   this is how mindfulness of in and out breathing is developed and pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination     and how are the four frames of reference developed and pursued so as to bring the seven factors for awakening to their culmination        on whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the body in and of itself    ardent  alert  and mindful    putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world  on that occasion his mindfulness is steady and without lapse  when his mindfulness is steady and without lapse  then mindfulness as a factor for awakening becomes aroused  he develops it  and for him it goes to the culmination of its development        remaining mindful in this way  he examines  analyzes  and comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment  when he remains mindful in this way  examining  analyzing  and coming to a comprehension of that quality with discernment  then analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening becomes aroused  he develops it  and for him it goes to the culmination of its development        in one who examines  analyzes  and comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment  unflagging persistence is aroused  when unflagging persistence is aroused in one who examines  analyzes  and comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment  then persistence as a factor for awakening becomes aroused  he develops it  and for him it goes to the culmination of its development        in one whose persistence is aroused  a rapture not of the flesh arises  when a rapture not of the flesh arises in one whose persistence is aroused  then rapture as a factor for awakening becomes aroused  he develops it  and for him it goes to the culmination of its development        for one who is enraptured  the body grows calm and the mind grows calm  when the body and mind of an enraptured monk grow calm  then serenity as a factor for awakening becomes aroused  he develops it  and for him it goes to the culmination of its development        for one who is at ease    his body calmed    the mind becomes concentrated  when the mind of one who is at ease    his body calmed    becomes concentrated  then concentration as a factor for awakening becomes aroused  he develops it  and for him it goes to the culmination of its development        he oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity  when he oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity  equanimity as a factor for awakening becomes aroused  he develops it  and for him it goes to the culmination of its development   similarly with the other three frames of reference  feelings  mind  and mental qualities   this is how the four frames of reference are developed and pursued so as to bring the seven factors for awakening to their culmination     and how are the seven factors for awakening developed and pursued so as to bring clear knowing and release to their culmination  there is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion    dispassion    cessation  resulting in relinquishment  he develops analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening    persistence as a factor for awakening    rapture as a factor for awakening    serenity as a factor for awakening    concentration as a factor for awakening    equanimity as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion    dispassion    cessation  resulting in relinquishment    this is how the seven factors for awakening  when developed and pursued  bring clear knowing and release to their culmination    that is what the blessed one said  gratified  ven  ananda delighted in the blessed one s words   on one occasion ven  ananda was staying near savatthi in jeta s grove  anathapindika s monastery  then early in the morning he put on his robes and  carrying his bowl and outer robe  went into savatthi for alms with ven  vangisa as his attendant monk  now at that time dissatisfaction with the chaste life had arisen in ven  vangisa  lust invaded his mind  so he addressed ven  ananda with this verse   with sensual lust i burn    my mind is on fire    please  gotama  from compassion    tell me how to put it out   from distorted perception     your mind is on fire    shun the theme of the beautiful     accompanied by lust    see mental fabrications as other      as stress      and not self  extinguish your great lust      don t keep burning again and again     develop the mind       well centered and one        in the foul    through the foul    have your mindfulness     immersed in the body    be one who pursues     disenchantment    develop the theme less    cast out conceit    then  from breaking through     conceit      you will go on your way at peace   i heard thus  at one time the blessed one lived in the monastery offered by anathapindika in jeta   s grove in savatthi  at that time venerable ananda was in the attendance hall  instructing  advising  and making the hearts light of the bhikkhus  with the short and detailed exposition of the single auspicious attachment  then the blessed one got up from his seclusion in the evening approached the attendance hall sat on the prepared seat and addressed the bhikkhus     bhikkhus  who was instructing  advising  and making the hearts light of the bhikkhus in the attendance hall  with the short and detailed exposition of the single auspicious attachment        venerable sir  venerable ananda  was instructing  advising  and making the hearts light of the bhikkhus in the attendance hall  with the short and detailed exposition of the single auspicious

auspicious attachment  the appeased sage tells     the blessed one said thus and venerable ananda delighted in the words of the blessed  i heard thus  at one time the blessed one lived in the monastery offered by anathapindika in jeta   s grove in savatthi  venerable shariputra addressed the bhikkhus   friends  bhikkhus   and those bhikkhus replied  yes  friend   and venerable shariputra said  friends  there are four persons in the world  what four   here  a certain person with blemish does not know  as it really is   there is blemish in me   a certain person with blemish knows  as it really is   there is blemish in me   a certain person without blemish does not know as it really is   there is no blemish in me   a certain person without blemish knows as it really is   there is no blemish in me   of the two persons with blemish  the one who does not know as it really is   there is blemish in me  is the inferior the one who knows as it really is   there is blemish in me  is the superior one  of the two persons without blemish  the one who does not know  as it really is   there is no blemish  is the inferior one  the one who knows as it really is   there is no blemish in me  is the superior  when this was said  venerable maha moggallana said   friend  shariputra  what is the reason that of the two with blemish that one should be inferior and the other superior and of the other two without blemish  what is the reason that one should be inferior and the other superior  here  friend  moggallana  this person with blemish  who does not know  as it really is   there is blemish in me   would not arouse interest  and make effort to dispel that blemish  so he would die with a defiled mind with greed  hate and delusion  just like a bronze bowl bought from a shop or smithy would be covered with dust and stains  its owner not partaking food in it would not clean it  would let it lie with dust and as time goes that bronze bowl would be much more dusty and stained  in the same way this person with blemish  who would not know  as it really is   there is blemish in me   would not arouse interest  and make effort to dispel that blemish  so he would die with a defiled mind with greed  hate and delusion  friend  this person with blemish  who knows  as it really is   there is blemish in me   would arouse interest  and make effort to dispel that blemish  he would die with a non defiled mind without greed  hate and delusion  just like a bronze bowl bought from a shop or smithy would be covered with dust and stains  its owner partaking food in it would clean it  would not let it lie with dirt and as time goes the bronze bowl would be more and more clean  in the same manner this person with blemish  who knows  as it really is   there is blemish in me   would arouse interest and make effort to dispel that blemish  so he would die with a non defiled mind without greed  hate  and delusion  friend  this person without blemish  who does not know  as it really is   there is no blemish in me   attending to an agreeable sign  greed would overcome his mind  hate and delusion would overcome his mind and he would die with a defiled mind  just like a bronze bowl bought from a shop or smithy clean and pure  the owner would not partake in it  would let it lie with dirt  then as time goes  that bronze bowl would be more and more dusty and stained in the same manner this person without blemish  who does not know  as it really is   there is no blemish in me   attending to an agreeable sign greed would overcome his mind  hate and delusion would overcome his mind and he would die with a defiled mind  friend  this person without blemish  who knows  as it really is   there is no blemish in me   attending to an agreeable sign  greed would not overcome his mind  hate and delusions would not overcome his mind  he would die without greed  hate and delusion  he would die with an undefiled mind  just like a bronze bowl bought from a shop or smithy  clean and pure  the owner would partake in it  would clean it and not let it lie in dirt  and as time goes that bronze bowl would be more and more clean  in the same manner this person without blemish  who knows  as it really is   there is no blemish in me   attending to an agreeable sign  greed  would not overcome his mind  hate and delusion would not overcome his mind  he would die without greed  hate and delusion  he would die with an undefiled mind  friend  moggallana  this is the reason for the two persons with blemish  one to be called inferior and the other superior  for the two persons without blemish  one to be called inferior and the other superior  friend  it is called blemish  what is a synonym for blemish  friend  blemish is the wanderings of thoughts  in evil

and heard to be dispelled in him    when this was said venerable maha moggallana said  friend  shariputra  a comparison occurs to me   friend  say it    friend  at one time  i was living in the mountains of rajagaha  then one morning wearing robes and taking bowl and robes i entered rajagaha  at that time samiiti the chariot maker   s son was bending the circumference of a wheel for an ascetic  the son of pandu  the earlier chariot maker    then it occurred to the ascetic  o  if samiiti   s son corrects these crooked nesses  slants  and faults and makes the wheel perfect  whatever crookedness  slant  or fault that the ascetic thought of  that and that he corrected and made the circumference of the wheel perfect  then the ascetic expressed words of pleasure and said   it s like he knew the heart with the heart   friend  shariputra  in the same manner  those making a livelihood without faith  crafty hypocrites  trained deceivers  unsteady  wavering  with loose talk  mental faculties not restrained  not knowing the right amount to partake  not yoked to wakefulness and not desirous of the recluse  ship  not honoring the training  living in abundance and lethargy  unyoked from seclusion  without effort  not mindful and aware  not concentrated  those lacking in wisdom deaf and dumb  hearing this discourse should know the heart with the heart and make repairs  as for those sons of clansmen gone forth out of faith  not crafty  not hypocrites  not trained deceivers  steady  without loose talk  mental faculties restrained  yoked to wakefulness  desirous of the recluse ship  honoring the training  not living in abundance and lethargy  yoked to seclusion with effort  mindful and aware  concentrated and wise  they hearing this discourse of venerable shariputra  i think should devour the word and thought of it  good if the co associates in the holy life raised themselves from demerit and got established in merit   the two great men delighted in each other   s words  thus have i heard  on one occasion the blessed one was living at savatthi in jeta   s grove  anathapindika   s park  there the venerable shariputra addressed the monks thus   friends  monks        friend   they replied  the venerable shariputra said this   friends  there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world  what four  here some person with a blemish does not understand it as it actually is thus     i have a blemish in myself     here some person with a blemish understands it as it actually is thus     i have a blemish in myself     here some person with no blemish does not understand it as it actually is thus     i have no blemish in myself     here some person with no blemish understands it as it actually is thus     i have no blemish in myself      herein  the person with a blemish who does not understand it as it actually is thus     i have a blemish in myself    is called the inferior of the two persons with a blemish  herein  the person with a blemish who understands it as it actually is thus     i have a blemish in myself    is called the superior of these two persons with a blemish   herein  the person with no blemish who does not understand it as it actually is thus     i have no blemish    is called the inferior of these two persons with no blemish  herein  the person with no blemish who understands it as it actually is thus     i have no blemish    is called the superior of these two persons with no blemish   when this was said  the venerable maha moggallana asked the venerable shariputra   friend shariputra  what is the cause and reason why  of these two persons with a blemish  one is called the inferior man and one is called the superior man  what is the cause and reason why  of these two persons with no blemish  one is called the inferior man and one is called the superior man    herein  friend  when a person with a blemish does not understand it as it is thus     i have a blemish in myself     it can be expected that he will not arouse zeal  make effort  or instigate energy to abandon that blemish  and that he will die with lust  hate  and delusion  with a blemish  with mind defiled  suppose a bronze dish were brought from a shop or a smithy covered with dirt and stains  and the owners neither used it nor had it cleaned  but put it away in a dusty corner  would the bronze dish thus get more defiled and stained later on        yes  friend        so too  friend  when a person with a blemish does not understand it as it is actually thus     i have a blemish in myself     it can be expected that he will not arouse zeal  make effort  or instigate energy to abandon that blemish  and that he will die with lust  hate  and delusion  with a blemish  with mind defiled   herein  when a person with a blemish understands it as it actually is thus     i have a blemish in myself     it can be expected that he will arouse zeal  make effort  instigate energy to abandon that blemish  and that he will die without lust  hate  and delusion  without blemish  with mind undefiled  suppose a bronze dish were brought from a shop or a smithy covered with dirt and stains  and the owners had cleaned it and did not put it in a dusty corner  would the bronze dish get cleaner and brighter later on        yes  friend        so too  friend  when a person with a blemish understands it as it actually is thus     i have a blemish in myself     it can be expected that he will arouse zeal  make effort  instigate energy to abandon that blemish  and that he will die without lust  hate  and delusion  without blemish  with mind undefiled   herein  when a person with no blemish does not understand it as it is actually thus     i have no blemish in myself     it can be expected that he will give attention to the sign of the beautiful  that by his doing so lust will infect his mind  and that he will die with lust  hate  and delusion  with a blemish  with mind defiled  suppose a bronze dish were brought from a shop or smithy clean and bright  and the owners neither used it nor had it cleaned  but put it in a dusty corner  would the bronze dish thus get more defiled and more stained later on        yes  friend        so too  friend  when a person with no blemish does not understand it as it is actually thus     i have no blemish in myself     it can be expected that he will give attention to the sign of the beautiful  that by his doing so lust will infect his mind  and that he will die with lust  hate  and delusion  with a blemish  with mind defiled   herein  when a person

infect his mind  and that he will die without lust  hate  and delusion  with no blemish  with mind undefiled   this is the cause and reason why  of these two persons with a blemish  one is called the inferior man and one is called the superior man  this is the cause and reason why  of these two persons with no blemish  one is called the inferior man and one is called the superior man   blemish  blemish  is said friend  but what is this word blemish a term for    blemish  friend  is a term for the spheres of evil unwholesome wishes   it is possible that a monk here might wish     if i commit an offence  let the monks not know that i have committed an offence     and it is possible that the monks come to know that that monk has committed an offence  so he is angry and bitter thus     the monks know that i have committed an offence     the anger and bitterness are both a blemish   it is possible that a monk here might wish     i have committed an offence  the monks should admonish me in private  not in the midst of the sangha     and it is possible that the monks admonish that monk in the midst of the sangha  not in private  so he is angry and bitter thus     the monks admonished

bitterness are both a blemish  blemish  friend  is a term for the spheres of these evil  unwholesome wishes   if the spheres of these evil  unwholesome wishes are seen and heard to be un abandoned in any monk  then for all that he may be a forest dweller  a frequenter of remote abodes  an alms food eater  a house to house seeker  a refuse rag wearer  a wearer of rough robes  still his fellows in the holy life do not honor  respect  revere  and venerate him  why is that  because the spheres of these evil unwholesome wishes are seen and heard to be un abandoned in that venerable one   suppose a metal bowl were brought from a shop or a smithy  clean and bright  and the owners put the carcass of a snake or a dog or a human being in it and  covering it with another bowl  went back to the market  then people seeing it said     what is that you are carrying about like a treasure     then  raising the lid and uncovering it  they looked in  and as soon as they saw they were inspired with such loathing  repugnance  and disgust  that even those who were hungry would not want to eat  not to speak of those who were full   so too if the spheres of these evil unwholesome wishes are seen and

that venerable one   if the spheres of these evil unwholesome wishes are seen and heard to be abandoned in any monk  then for all that he may be a village dweller  an accepter of invitations  a wearer

was said  the venerable maha moggallana said to the venerable shariputra   a simile occurs to me friend shariputra        state it friend moggallana    on one occasion  friend  i was living at the hill fort at rajagaha  then  when it was morning  i dressed  and taking my bowl and outer robe  i went into rajagaha for alms  now on that occasion samiti  the cartwright   s son  was smoothing a beam of wood and the ajivaka  a rival sect that practices severe austerities and believed in the concept of fate   panduputta  son of a former cartwright was standing by  then this thought arose in the ajivaka panduputta   s mind     o that this samiti  the cartwright son might plane this bend  this twist  this fault out of the wood so that it would be without bends  twists  or faults and come to consist purely of heartwood     and just as this thought came to pass in his mind so did samiti  the cartwright   s son plane that bend  that twist  that fault  out of the wood  then the ajivaka panduputta  son of a former cartwright was glad and he voiced his gladness thus     he planes just as if he knew my heart with his heart      so too friend  there are persons who are faithless and have gone forth from the home life into homelessness not out of faith  but seeking a livelihood  who are fraudulent  deceitful  treacherous  haughty  hollow  personally vain  rough tongued  loose spoken  unguarded in the sense faculties  immoderate in eating  un devoted to wakefulness  unconcerned with recluse ship  not greatly respectful of training  luxurious  careless  leaders in backsliding  neglectful of seclusion  lazy  wanting in energy  unmindful  not fully aware  un concentrated  with straying minds  devoid of wisdom  drivellers  the venerable shariputra with his discourse on the dhamma planes out their faults just as if he knew my heart with his heart    but there are clansmen who have gone forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness  who are not fraudulent  deceitful  treacherous  haughty  hollow  personally vain  rough tongued  or loose spoken  who are guarded in their sense faculties  moderate in eating  devoted to wakefulness  concerned with recluse ship  greatly respectful of training  not luxurious or careless  who are keen to avoid backsliding  leaders in seclusion  energetic  resolute  established in mindfulness  fully aware  concentrated  with unified minds  possessing wisdom  not drivellers  these  on hearing the venerable shariputra   s discourse on the dhamma drink it in and eat it as it were by word and thought  good indeed it is that he makes his fellows in the holy life emerge from the unwholesome and establish themselves in the wholesome   just as a woman or a man  young  youthful  fond of adornments  with head bathed  having received a garland of lotuses  jasmine  or roses would take it with both hands and place it on the head  so too there are clansmen who have gone forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness who are not fraudulent  deceitful  treacherous  haughty  hollow  personally vain  rough tongued  or loose spoken  who are guarded in their sense faculties  moderate in eating  devoted to wakefulness  concerned with recluse ship  greatly respectful of training  not luxurious or careless  who are keen to avoid backsliding  leaders in seclusion  energetic  resolute  established in mindfulness  fully aware  concentrated  with unified minds  possessing wisdom  not drivellers  these  on hearing the venerable shariputra discourse on the dhamma drink it in and eat it as it were by word and thought  good indeed it is that he makes his fellows in the holy life emerge from the unwholesome and establish himself in the wholesome   thus it was that these two great beings rejoiced in each others good words  i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at savatthi in the eastern monastery  the palace of migara s mother  together will many well known elder disciples    with ven  shariputra  ven  maha moggallana  ven  maha kassapa  ven  maha kaccayana  ven  maha kotthita  ven  maha kappina  ven  maha cunda  ven  revata  ven  ananda  and other well known elder disciples  on that occasion the elder monks were teaching and instructing  some elder monks were teaching and instructing ten monks  some were teaching and instructing twenty monks  some were teaching and instructing thirty monks  some were teaching and instructing forty monks  the new monks  being taught and instructed by the elder monks  were discerning grand  successive distinctions  now on that occasion    the uposatha day of the fifteenth  the full moon night of the pavarana ceremony    the blessed one was seated in the open air surrounded by the community of monks  surveying the silent community of monks  he addressed them   monks  i am content with this practice  i am content at heart with this practice  so arouse even more intense persistence for the attaining of the as yet unattained  the reaching of the as yet un reached  the realization of the as yet unrealized  i will remain right here at savatthi  for another month  through the  white water lily  month  the fourth month of the rains   the monks in the countryside heard   the blessed one  they say  will remain right there at savatthi through the white water lily month  the fourth month of the rains   so they left for savatthi to see the blessed one  then the elder monks taught and instructed even more intensely  some elder monks were teaching and instructing ten monks  some were teaching and instructing twenty monks  some were teaching and instructing thirty monks  some were teaching and instructing forty monks  the new monks  being taught and instructed by the elder monks  were discerning grand  successive distinctions  now on that occasion    the uposatha day of the fifteenth  the full moon night of the white water lily month  the fourth month of the rains    the blessed one was seated in the open air surrounded by the community of monks  surveying the silent community of monks  he addressed them   monks  this assembly is free from idle chatter  devoid of idle chatter  and is established on pure heartwood  such is this community of monks  such is this assembly  the sort of assembly that is worthy of gifts  worthy of hospitality  worthy of offerings  worthy of respect  an incomparable field of merit for the world  such is this community of monks such is this assembly  the sort of assembly to which a small gift  when given  becomes great  and a great gift greater  such is this community of monks such is this assembly  the sort of assembly that it is rare to see in the world  such is this community of monks  such is this assembly    the sort of assembly that it would be worth traveling for leagues  taking along provisions  in order to see   in this community of monks there are monks who are arahants  whose mental effluents are ended  who have reached fulfillment  done the task  laid down the burden attained the true goal  totally destroyed the fetter of becoming  and who are released through right gnosis  such are the monks in this community of monks   in this community of monks there are monks who  with the total ending of the first set of five fetters  are due to be reborn  in the pure abodes   there to be totally unbound  never again to return from that world  such are the monks in this community of monks   in this community of monks there are monks who  with the totally ending of  the first  three fetters  and the with attenuation of passion  aversion  and delusion  are once returners  who    on returning only one more time to this world    will make an ending to stress  such are the monks in this community of monks   in this community of monks there are monks who  with the total ending of  the first  three fetters  are stream winners  steadfast  never again destined for states of woe  headed for self awakening  such are the monks in this community of monks   in this community of monks there are monks who remain devoted to the development of the four frames of reference     the four right exertions     the four bases of power     the five faculties     the five strengths     the seven factors of awakening     the noble eightfold path  such are the monks in this community of monks   in this community of monks there are monks who remain devoted to the development of good will     compassion     appreciation     equanimity     the perception of the foulness of the body     the perception of inconstancy  such are the monks in this community of monks   in this community of monks there are monks who remain devoted to mindfulness of in and out breathing   mindfulness of in and out breath  when developed and pursued  is of great fruit  of great benefit  mindfulness of in and out breathing  when developed and pursued  brings the four frames of reference to their culmination  the four frames of reference  when developed and pursued  bring the seven factors of awakening to their culmination  the seven factors of awakening  when developed and pursued  bring clear knowing and release to their culmination   now how is mindfulness of in and out breathing developed and pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination   there is the case where a monk  having gone to the wilderness  to the shade of a tree  or to an empty building  sits down folding his legs crosswise  holding his body erect  and setting mindfulness to the fore  always mindful  he breathes in  mindful he breathes out       breathing in long  he discerns that he is breathing in long  or breathing out long  he discerns that he is breathing out long      or breathing in short  he discerns that he is breathing in short  or breathing out short  he discerns that he is breathing out short      he trains himself to breathe in sensitive to the entire body  and to breathe out sensitive to the entire body      he trains himself to breathe in calming the bodily processes  and to breathe out calming the bodily processes       he trains himself to breathe in sensitive to rapture  and to breathe out sensitive to rapture      he trains himself to breathe in sensitive to pleasure  and to breathe out sensitive to pleasure      he trains himself to breathe in sensitive to mental processes  and to breathe out sensitive to mental processes      he trains himself to breathe in calming mental processes  and to breathe out calming mental processes       he trains himself to breathe in sensitive to the mind  and to breathe out sensitive to the mind       he trains himself to breathe in satisfying the mind  and to breathe out satisfying the mind       he trains himself to breathe in steadying the mind  and to breathe out steadying the mind       he trains himself to breathe in releasing the mind  and to breathe out releasing the mind        he trains himself to breathe in focusing on inconstancy  and to breathe out focusing on inconstancy       he trains himself to breathe in focusing on dispassion  literally  fading   and to breathe out focusing on dispassion       he trains himself to breathe in focusing on cessation  and to breathe out focusing on cessation       he trains himself to breathe in focusing on relinquishment  and to breathe out focusing on relinquishment       now  on whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns that he is breathing in long  or breathing out long  discerns that he is breathing out long  or breathing in short  discerns that he is breathing in short  or breathing out short  discerns that he is breathing out short  trains himself to breathe in   and    out sensitive to the entire body  trains himself to breathe in   and   out calming the bodily processes  on that occasion the monk remains focused on the body in and of itself    ardent  alert  and mindful    subduing greed and distress with reference to the world  i tell you  monks  that this    the in and out breath    is classed as a body among bodies  which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in and of itself    ardent  alert  and mindful    putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world       on whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in   and   out sensitive to rapture  trains himself to breathe in   and   out sensitive to pleasure  trains himself to breathe in   and   out sensitive to mental processes  trains himself to breathe in   and   out calming mental processes  on that occasion the monk remains focused on feelings in and of themselves    ardent  alert  and mindful    subduing greed and distress with reference to the world  i tell you  monks  that this    close attention to in and out breaths    is classed as a feeling among feelings  which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on feelings in and of themselves    ardent  alert  and mindful    putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world       on whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in   and   out sensitive to the mind  trains himself to breathe in   and   out satisfying the mind  trains himself to breathe in   and   out steadying the mind  trains himself to breathe in   and   out releasing the mind  on that occasion the monk remains focused on the mind in and of itself    ardent  alert  and mindful    subduing greed and distress with reference to the world  i don t say that there is mindfulness of in and out breathing in one of confused mindfulness and no alertness  which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in and of itself    ardent  alert  and mindful    putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world       on whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in   and   out focusing on inconstancy  trains himself to breathe in   and   out focusing on dispassion  trains himself to breathe in   and   out focusing on cessation  trains himself to breathe in   and   out focusing on relinquishment  on that occasion the monk remains focused on mental qualities in and of themselves    ardent  alert  and mindful    subduing greed and distress with reference to the world  he who sees clearly with discernment the abandoning of greed and distress is one who oversees with equanimity  which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in and of themselves    ardent  alert  and mindful    putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world   this is how mindfulness of in and out breathing is developed and pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination   and how are the four frames of reference developed and pursued so as to bring the seven factors of awakening to their culmination       on whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the body in and of itself    ardent  alert  and mindful    putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world  on that occasion his mindfulness is steady and without lapse  when his mindfulness is steady and without lapse  then mindfulness as a factor of awakening becomes aroused  he develops it  and for him it goes to the culmination of its development       remaining mindful in this way  he examines  analyzes  and comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment  when he remains mindful in this way  examining  analyzing  and coming to a comprehension of that quality with discernment  then analysis of qualities as a factor of awakening becomes aroused  he develops it  and for him it goes to the culmination of its development       in one who examines  analyzes  and comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment  unflagging persistence is aroused  when unflagging persistence is aroused in one who examines  analyzes  and comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment  then persistence as a factor of awakening becomes aroused  he develops it  and for him it goes to the culmination of its development       in one whose persistence is aroused  a rapture not of the flesh arises  when a rapture not of the flesh arises in one whose persistence is aroused  then rapture as a factor of awakening becomes aroused  he develops it  and for him it goes to the culmination of its development       for one who is enraptured  the body grows calm and the mind grows calm  when the body and mind of an enraptured monk grow calm  then serenity as a factor of awakening becomes aroused  he develops it  and for him it goes to the culmination of its development       for one who is at ease    his body calmed    the mind becomes concentrated  when the mind of one who is at ease    his body calmed    becomes concentrated  then concentration as a factor of awakening becomes aroused  he develops it  and for him it goes to the culmination of its development       he oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity  when he oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity  equanimity as a factor of awakening becomes aroused  he develops it  and for him it goes to the culmination of its development   similarly with the other three frames of reference  feelings  mind  and mental qualities    this is how the four frames of reference are developed and pursued so as to bring the seven factors of awakening to their culmination   and how are the seven factors of awakening developed and pursued so as to bring clear knowing and release to their culmination  there is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor of awakening dependent on seclusion     dispassion     cessation  resulting in relinquishment  he develops analysis of qualities as a factor of awakening     persistence as a factor of awakening     rapture as a factor of awakening     serenity as a factor of awakening    concentration as a factor of awakening     equanimity as a factor of awakening dependent on seclusion     dispassion     cessation  resulting in relinquishment   this is how the seven factors of awakening  when developed and pursued  bring clear knowing and release to their culmination   that is what the blessed one said  glad at heart  the monks delighted in the blessed one s words  i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near savatthi  in jeta s grove  anathapindika s monastery  and on that occasion anathapindika the householder was diseased  in pain  severely ill  then anathapindika the householder said to one of his men   come  my good man  go to the blessed one and  on arrival  pay homage to his feet with your head in my name and say  lord  anathapindika the householder is diseased  in pain  severely ill  he pays homage with his head to the blessed one s feet   then go to ven  sariputta and  on arrival  pay homage to his feet with your head in my name and say  venerable sir  anathapindika the householder is diseased  in pain  severely ill  he pays homage with his head to your feet   then say   it would be good if ven  sariputta would visit anathapindika s home  out of sympathy for him    responding   as you say  lord   to anathapindika the householder  the man went to the blessed one and  on arrival  bowed down to him and sat to one side  as he was sitting there he said   lord  anathapindika the householder is diseased  in pain  severely ill  he pays homage with his head to the blessed one s feet   then he went to ven  sariputta and  on arrival  on arrival  bowed down to him and sat to one side  as he was sitting there he said   venerable sir  anathapindika the householder is diseased  in pain  severely ill  he pays homage with his head to your feet   then he said   it would be good if ven  sariputta would visit anathapindika s home  out of sympathy for him   then ven  sariputta  taking his bowl   robe  went to the home of anathapindika the householder with ven  ananda as his attendant  on arrival  he sat down on a prepared seat and said to anathapindika the householder   i hope you are getting better  householder  i hope you are comfortable  i hope that your pains are lessening and not increasing  i hope that there are signs of their lessening  and not of their increasing    anathapindika    i am not getting better  venerable sir  i am not comfortable  my extreme pains are increasing  not lessening  there are signs of their increasing  and not of their lessening  extreme forces slice through my head  just as if a strong man were slicing my head open with a sharp sword    extreme pains have arisen in my head  just as if a strong man were tightening a turban made of tough leather straps around my head    extreme forces carve up my stomach cavity  just as if a butcher or his apprentice were to carve up the stomach cavity of an ox    there is an extreme burning in my body  just as if two strong men  grabbing a weaker man by the arms  were to roast and broil him over a pit of hot embers  i am not getting better  venerable sir  i am not comfortable  my extreme pains are increasing

cling to the dimension of the infinitude of space    the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness    the dimension of nothingness  my consciousness will not be dependent on the dimension of nothingness        i won t cling to the sphere of neither perception nor non perception  my consciousness will not be dependent on the sphere of neither perception nor non perception   that s how you should train yourself   then  householder  you should train yourself in this way   i won t cling to this world  my consciousness will not be dependent on this world    i won t cling to the world beyond  my consciousness will not be dependent on the world beyond   that s how you should train yourself   then  householder  you should train yourself in this way   i won t cling to what is seen  heard  sensed  cognized  attained  sought after  pondered by the intellect  my consciousness will not be dependent on that   that s how you should train yourself   when this was said  anathapindika the householder wept and shed tears  ven  ananda said to him   are you sinking  householder  are you foundering    no  venerable sir  i m not sinking  nor am i foundering  it s just that for a long time i have attended to the teacher  and to the monks who inspire my heart  but never before have i heard a talk on the dhamma like this    this sort of talk on the dhamma  householder  is not given to lay people clad in white  this sort of talk on the dhamma is given to those gone forth    in that case  ven  sariputta  please let this sort of talk on the dhamma be given to lay people clad in white  there are clansmen with little dust in their eyes who are wasting away through not hearing  this  dhamma  there will be those who will understand it   then ven  sariputta and ven  ananda  having given this instruction to anathapindika the householder  got up from their seats and left  then  not long after they left  anathapindika the householder died and reappeared in the tusita heaven  then anathapindika the deva s son  in the far extreme of the night  his extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of jeta s grove  went to the blessed one and  on arrival  bowed down to him and stood to one side  as he was standing there  he addressed the blessed one with this verse  this blessed jeta s grove    home to the community of seers    where there dwells the dhamma king    the source of rapture for me  action  clear knowing    mental qualities       virtue  the highest  way of  life           through this are mortals purified           not through clan or wealth  thus the wise    seeing their own benefit    investigating the dhamma appropriately    should purify themselves right there  as for sariputta     any monk who has gone beyond     at best can only equal him    in discernment  virtue    calm  that is what anathapindika the deva s son said  the teacher approved  then anathapindika the deva s son   knowing    the teacher has approved of me   bowed down to him  circled him three times  keeping him to his right  and then disappeared right there  then when the night had past  the blessed one addressed the monks   last night  monks  a certain deva s son in the far extreme of the night  his extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of jeta s grove  came to me and  on arrival  bowed down to me and stood to one side  as he was standing there  he addressed me with this verse  this blessed jeta s grove    home to the community of seers    where there dwells the dhamma king           the source of rapture for me  action  clear knowing    mental qualities    virtue  the highest  way of  life           through this are mortals purified     not through clan or wealth  thus the wise    seeing their own benefit    investigating the dhamma appropriately    should purify themselves right there  as for sariputta  any monk who has gone beyond     at best can only equal him    in discernment  virtue    calm   that is what the deva s son said  and  thinking    the teacher has approved of me   he bowed down to me  circled me three times  and then disappeared right there   when this was said  ven  ananda said to the blessed one   lord  that must have been anathapindika the deva s son  anathapindika the householder had supreme confidence in ven  sariputta    very good  ananda  very good  to the extent that you have deduced what can be arrived at through logic  that was anathapindika the deva s son  and no one else   that is what the blessed one said  gratified  ven  ananda delighted in the blessed one s words  i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at varanasi in the game refuge at isipatana  there he addressed the group of five monks   form  monks  is not self  if form were the self  this form would not lend itself to

through lack of clinging  were released from the mental effluents  on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the magadhans at andhakavinda  then ven  ananda went to him and  having bowed down to him  sat to one side  as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him   ananda  the new monks    those who have not long gone forth  who are newcomers in this dhamma and discipline    should be encouraged  exhorted  and established in these five things  which five    come  friends  be virtuous  dwell restrained in accordance with the patimokkha  consummate in your behavior and sphere of activity  train yourselves  having undertaken the training rules  seeing danger in the slightest faults   thus they should be encouraged  exhorted  and established in restraint in accordance with the patimokkha    come  friends  dwell with your sense faculties guarded  with mindfulness as your protector  with mindfulness as your chief  with your intellect self protected  endowed with an awareness protected by mindfulness   thus they should be encouraged  exhorted  and established in restraint of the senses    come  friends  speak only a little  place limits on your conversation   thus they should be encouraged  exhorted  and established in limited conversation    come  friends  dwell in the wilderness  resort to remote wilderness and forest dwellings   thus they should be encouraged  exhorted  and established in physical seclusion   come  friends  develop right view  be endowed with right vision   thus they should be encouraged  exhorted  and established in right vision   new monks    those who have not long gone forth  who are newcomers in this dhamma and discipline    should be encouraged  exhorted  and established in these five things   i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in the kuru country  now there is a town of the kurus called kammasadhamma  there the blessed one addressed the monks   monks    yes  lord   the monks responded  the blessed one said   monks  sensuality is inconstant  hollow  vain  deceptive  it is illusory  the babble of fools  sensuality here and now  sensuality in lives to come  sensual perceptions here and now  sensual perceptions in lives to come  both are mara s realm  mara s domain  mara s bait  mara s range  they lead to these evil  unskillful mental states  greed  ill will  and contentiousness  they arise for the obstruction of a disciple of the noble ones here in training   in that case  the disciple of the noble ones considers this   sensuality here and now  sensuality in lives to come  sensual perceptions here and now  sensual perceptions in lives to come  both are mara s realm  mara s domain  mara s bait  mara s range  they lead to these evil  unskillful mental states  greed  ill will  and contentiousness  they arise for the obstruction of a disciple of the noble ones here in training  what if i    overpowering the world  of the five senses  and having determined my mind    were to dwell with an awareness that was abundant and enlarged  having done so  these evil  unskillful mental states    greed  ill will  and contentiousness    would not come into being  with their abandoning  my mind would become unlimited  immeasurable  and well developed   practicing and frequently abiding in this way  his mind acquires confidence in that dimension  there being full confidence  he either attains the imperturbable     now or else is committed to discernment  with the break up of the body  after death  it s possible that this leading on consciousness of his will go to the imperturbable  this is declared to be the first practice conducive to the imperturbable   then again  the disciple of the noble ones considers this   sensuality here and now  sensuality in lives to come  sensual perceptions here and now  sensual perceptions in lives to come  whatever is form  every form  is the four great elements or a form derived from the four great elements   practicing and

neither perception nor non perception  when this was said  ven  ananda said to the blessed one   there is the case  lord  where a monk  having practiced in this way     it should not be  it should not occur to me  it will not be  it will not occur to me  what is  what has come to be  that i abandon     obtains equanimity  now  would this monk be totally unbound  or not    a certain such monk might  ananda  and another might not    what is the cause  what is the reason  whereby one might and another might not    there is the case  ananda  where a monk  having practiced in this way     thinking   it should not be  it should not occur to me  it will not be  it will not occur to me  what is  what has come to be  that i abandon     obtains equanimity  he relishes that equanimity  welcomes it  remains fastened to it  as he relishes that equanimity  welcomes it  remains fastened to it  his consciousness is dependent on it  is sustained by it  clings to it   with clinging sustenance  ananda  a monk is not totally unbound    being sustained  where is that monk sustained    the dimension of neither perception nor non perception    then  indeed  being sustained  he is sustained by the supreme sustenance    being sustained  ananda  he is sustained by the supreme sustenance  for this    the dimension of neither perception nor non perception    is the supreme sustenance  there is  however  the case where a monk  having practiced in this way     it should not be  it should not occur to me  it will not be  it will not occur to me  what is  what has come to be  that i abandon     obtains equanimity  he does not relish that equanimity  does not welcome it  does not remain fastened to it  as does not relish that equanimity  does not welcome it  does not remain fastened to it  his consciousness is not dependent on it  is not sustained by it  does not cling to it   without clinging sustenance  ananda  a monk is totally unbound    it s amazing  lord  it s astounding  for truly  the blessed one has declared to us the way to cross over the flood by going from one support to the next  but what is the noble liberation    there is the case  ananda  where a disciple of the noble ones considers this   sensuality here and now  sensuality in lives to come  sensual perceptions here and now  sensual perceptions in lives to come  forms here and now  forms in lives to come  form perceptions here and now  form perceptions in lives to come  perceptions of the imperturbable  perceptions of the dimension of nothingness  perceptions of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception  that is an identity  to the extent that there is an identity  this is deathless  the liberation of the mind through lack of clinging sustenance    now  ananda  i have taught the practice conducive to the imperturbable  i have taught the practice conducive to the dimension of nothingness  i have taught the practice conducive to the dimension of neither perception nor non perception  i have taught the way to cross over the flood by going from one support to the next  the noble liberation  whatever a teacher should do    seeking the welfare of his disciples  out of sympathy for them    that have i done for you  over there are the roots of trees  over there  empty dwellings  practice jhana  ananda  don t be heedless  don t later fall into regret  this is our message to you all   that is what the blessed one said  gratified  ven  ananda delighted in the blessed one s words '
